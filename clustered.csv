Hard to discern what the flagger behind the two trucks was doing - he was not standing where someone would know what to do.,12
"Upon arrival, flagger gave clear direction to enter the work zone. The flagger at the other end of the work zone was standing on the center line with his back to the flow of traffic. A distracted driver would have likely hit him. Asked flaggers to stand on the edge of the roadway with an escape plan in place. Effective communication - Two flagging operations within close proximity of each other. Total of four flaggers. Flagging operations were in close proximity, but could be operated separately. The two flagging operations used the same radio channel to communicate. Communications appeared to be clutter and confusing. Suggested using separate channels.",12

Flagger on east end of work zone was using a cell phone and flagging traffic. As I approached the work zone the flaggers head was down looking at his phone with the STOP side of the paddle facing my direction. I saw the flagger answer his handheld radio then flipped the paddle to SLOW. [NAME] never looked up as I entered the work zone. I stopped at the west end of the work zone to communicate the hazard.,12

"Flagger was on wrong side of road due to shift in work, was addressed o quickly by senior flagger, peer coaching was received with a positive attitude.",12
Observed one of the flaggers with his Stop / Slow paddle broke into and placed in a cone. Flagger was not utilizing the paddle when holding or releasing traffic into the work zone. Spoke with the foreman and corrections were made accordingly.,12
"Flagger leaned his Slow / Stop Paddle stick against bucket truck, breaking barricade while lineman aloft was within MAD but not hands on. [NAME] did this to help spot a tractor pulling a set of disc's to get by safely. I spoke with crew foreman & flagger about what the barricade was for and that communication is to made with lineman aloft so he can move at least 10' out of the wires before reaching across or breaking barricade. This example illustrates why signs are required to be placed on barricades as the flagger had no idea what the rope meant.",12
2 crews working together using flaggers and the signs were too far from the work location. The flagger symbol sign was ~1 / 2 mile from where the flagger was standing. I explained to the crews that it should be around 500 - 800 feet for the road they were on. They were going to reposition signs asap.,12
Seen flagger sitting on tailgate and not visible to coming drivers. I talked to him and explained to him the importance of being seen easy by oncoming traffic,12
Flagger looking at cellular phone while holding STOP sign. Recommend not looking at phone when traffic is stopped or moving through pattern.,12

"Flaggers were sitting in truck with no cones around a bucket truck that was aloft, no work zone set up. Flagger jumped out and grabbed a paddle and stood behind his truck when he saw me pull up. Flagger stated that they were resting from walking the work zone to move cones and that there were not given adequate equipment for the required job. I coached the flagging crew how to set up a workable work zone and asked the line crew to slow down a bit to allow the flagging crew to keep up. Once the worksite was operating in safe manner I called AWP management to inform them of the situation.",12
Taper was to short. About 5 feet off the back of [NAME] Logix truck Only one flagger at far end of work zone. No flagger at taper of zone [NAME] distances inconsistent with big gaps along work zone,12
Flagger truck was right behind flagger stand. WV requires truck to be 100 feet back. F Flagger had stop / slow paddle being held up with cones. Paddle must be held with hand.,12
"sign symbols starting to tear off on several of crews signs needs replaced, Flagger and truck to close to crews bucket in case of impact flagger vehicle needs to be back farther and taper and buffer longer, coached flaggers",12
Coached AWP flaggers that they needed a better place to set up the flagging station for each flagger. Flaggers were not completely viable to traffic when we arrived at site. Coached them to get work zone complete before company crews were allowed to enter it. NO RUSHING.,12
Flagger was confused with direction and shut down a lane of traffic without the proper zone set up. Did not have proper signs nor cone usage. ( T & C 10. 6 ),12
"Neither direction had an End Road [NAME] sign. Westbound flagging emblem sign was approximately 1500 before flagger ( should have been no more than 500 ). [NAME] to crew shifting to another pole, eastbound buffer had not been adjusted to minimum 360 - 380 ( approximately 150 instead ).",12

Coachable: Flagger was coached on 50' buffer. Buffer was only at 20'. Buffer was corrected and LCS notified of the coaching.,12
When arrived to job site flagger was between lane closed and flagger sign flagging traffic. Discussed with crew proper position for flagger and sign spacing.,12
Flagger was standing in the road while flagging. I repositioned the flagger on the shoulder of the road to keep him out of the Line of Fire.,12
Inadequate length of approach buffer and no departure buffer. Departure side taper too short. Flagger symbol sign on the approach side of the work zone was too far from the flagger ( couldn't see sign and flagger ). [NAME] approach buffer would have put the flagger close enough to see sign and flagger.,12
"The [NAME] was provided Coaching as the set up did not warn all of the approaching traffic directions. Not enough Warning Signs were in place, especially on the cross streets tot he [NAME] Zone. AFAD was set up across the Intersection from the work. The [NAME] was sitting in their truck and relying on the AFADs, instead of Flagging the [NAME] Zone. No Flagger was in place at the Intersection, until after the Coaching. [NAME] the attached photos. Give Em A [NAME] Management was made aware of the situation and asked to provide some additional educational opportunities for this [NAME].",12
Flagger entered into the work zone to see what was going on since street was closed off and they were not actively flagging at the time. They were coached on staying out of work zone and some of the hazards that they may expose themselves to.,12
RD. [NAME] only had work area ahead signs up during a flagging operation. The crew was also only using one flagger on a divided road close to and intersection.,12
Flagger left station to inform a member of the line crew that an AEP person arrived on site. Since there was no flagger at station it confused an oncoming public driver,12
2 crews working together with flaggers and the signs were too far from the work site. It was ~1 / 2 mile between the flagger symbol sign and where the flagger was standing. I explained this to the crews and showed them in the flagging manual and they were going to reposition their signs asap.,12
Sign spacing was good except the flagger symbol signs on each end were too far from the flagger positions. All signs should have been moved closer to the job site. Both buffers were significantly shorter than required.,12
SIF Hit by vehicle - Flagger was stationed about 10 yards away from the flagger sign not giving the public enough warning.,12
* Flagger station distance was not properly maintained in advance of the work space. Flagger was staged at the back of the shadow vehicle within the WAP zone. Flagger should always be safely positioned away from the work area to stop vehicular traffic prior to reaching taper / buffer.,12
Flagger was away from her paddle having to motion to vehicles to stop or slow down because another traffic control employee was needed for a blind spot in the road way.,12
[NAME] had one lane closed and the flagger was not using a stop slow Paddle. asked him to get one and talked to crew and Gf,12
"not much of a taper only had one flagger at first, disorganized someone chipping without the set up being done all the way on very busy road",12
"work zone contained "" "" work area ahead "" "" and "" "" flagger "" "" signs but not a "" "" one lane Road ahead "" "" notification",12
"Neither Flagger was holding a Slow / Stop paddle, as they were laying on the ground. They were directing traffic with there hands, and not the paddles.",12
One concern noted was that the flagger left his flagging position a few times to talk with his partner at the other end of the work zone.,12
RC - 2 crews were set up on a limited visibility double yellow with no flagger signs or flaggers present allowing passerbys to self regulate blind turns,12
The crew did not have all the proper signs set up ( missing the flagger sign ). The crew also did not have the zone properly set up due to the addition of the intersection.,12
Flagger wasn't adhering to buffer zone between him and the work area. Had him expand his buffer zone.,12
Too large of a work zone was set up. Flagger sign must be in site of flagger station. Flagger signs on both ends of work area were 1 / 2 mile plus from flagger.,12
[NAME] had one flagged watching traffic. This job was on a busier county road and with the fog and a slight hill suggestion was made for the need of another flagger. LCS assigned one more crew member to flag. Both flangers could see each other for communication.,12
One flagger was only using a red flag waving it up and down in addition waving her hand motioning traffic to go through the work zone. No stop / go paddle being used.,12
"Not enough buffer between Flagger and crew, coached on proper buffer space between crew and Flagger position",12
[NAME] had their signs too far away on one side of operation. it was 1 mile from the flagman symbol sign to where the flagger was standing on the northbound side of work location,12
"Flagger sign, the last sign of the package was in place at all four crossroads. However, the sign was prior to an intersection which allowed vehicular traffic to turn into the WAP zone and encroach the flagger without any warning. Corrected by crew members..",12
[NAME] was missing one flagger symbol sign and one end road work sign. [NAME] immediately deployed them when coached.,12
2 separate occasions during my job site visit 2 public vehicles did not comply with the flagger and not stop. 1 separate vehicle ran over a cone and dragged it app 50 yards.,12
Flagger stationed at a side road was not using his Stop / Slow paddle ( it was leaning against the pickup truck ) as he was directing traffic with his hands.,12
Flagman sign too close to flagger. Traffic was backing up to the last sign. [NAME] spacing addressed with crew,12
1. No herbicide on truck 2. No tree crew packet on truck 3. 1 flagger did not have flagger certification card with them or registered tech card 4. Only 1 chainsaw on truck,12
"Insufficient buffer space on upstream side and none on downstream side. No taper on downstream side. Flag symbol sign on downstream side not visible inline with flagger. With proper buffer on downstream side, flagger could have been visible inline with sign.",12
"2 employees ( flagger and groundman ) were omitted from the briefing, but added after forester noticed.",12
"Flagger talked about sIgnIng main entrance in briefing but forgot to place sIgnage on main entrance, Stopped and placed signs at main entrance so all drivers would be aware of the work zone ahead. 15 MPH subdivision",12
"No shadow vehicle with bucket aloft. Individual sign spacing good, however, spacing to the flagger on the downstream side was too much. [NAME] had intended to move that direction through the day and didn't want to move signs each time. Insufficient buffer on both sides and no downstream taper.",12
Flagger sign was not in sight of flagger. I explained placing sign within sight of flagger provides one last warning prior to traffic entering work area. [NAME] relocated sign.,12
I notified the lead flagger that one of the traffic control signs had blown over ahead of the work area.,12
"One flagger has no STOP / SLOW sign, and the other has the sign but was not using it. Coached flagger on the importance of using the sign to prevent miscommunication with drivers.",12
"One flagger only wearing one hi - vis gaiters, not one per leg. Tapers and buffers insufficient length.",12
Both flaggers were maintaining good communication however on the east side of the zone a car chose to ignore the stop sign on their side and proceeded to enter the zone at the same time a vehicle was release from the opposite direction. There was enough space for the car to stop and pull on the shoulder of the road as the flagger attempted to get their attention. Both vehicles were able to safely make it through the zone and nobody got hurt,12
Flagger was on the phone. Coached the flagger on keeping mind on the task to help provide ample safety to those working in the work zone as well as To the public,12
[NAME] member was trying to flag from inside his truck. I talked to the crew and let them know the correct position for a flagger.,12
Within the zone there was a feeder road that was not flagged which allowed traffic to enter area without knowledge of work / flagger ahead.,12
One of the flaggers was staged in a turn which made it hard for oncoming vehicular traffic to see / spot the spotter. Flagger was moved prior to the start of the turn to allow the flagger to be more visible and be in a safer location overall.,12
Flagger was positioned severla yards before flagger sign for warning traffic. Stopped job and explained why it is important to have road area work zones set up correctly. [NAME] made adjustments on site,12
Flaggers closed a dead - end road leading to an apartment complex. I requested signs be installed at the apartment and a flagger be stationed to monitor the traffic in and out of the complex. The flaggers made the adjustments as requested.,12
"MJ Electric [NAME] unloading crane off of lo - boy on relatively busy state highway with one lane blocked. Flaggers were used but there was no signage ( work ahead, one lane closed, flagger ahead ).",12
Flagger was standing to close to the taper and needed to get some space out ahead. Also he was standing almost in the middle of the lane. GF told the flagger to move up so he could get the attention of private vehicles and to stand closer to the shoulder so he would have a good escape route if needed.,12
Flaggers on either end of the work zone were not protected by area which had tapered cones which allowed the traffic to pull up directly to the flagger.,12
[NAME] was working 1 mile away from the Flagger Ahead sign. job was stopped and corrected during visit,12
"[NAME] members failed to recognize hazards associated with the setup location of where one of the flangers was in relation to the entire work area and by not being highly visible to oncoming vehicular traffic. Flagger could have staged the start of the WAP zone around the turn at the end of straight stretch where they would have been the most visible to oncoming traffic. By doing so, the flagger and O. H. line crews would have been at a lower risk for a potential line of fire hazard.",12
One of the Flaggers was coached for not paying attention; as he caused a vehicle to wait to be let through the [NAME] Zone at the AFAD for almost five minutes. And then the Line [NAME] waved him through. Not really sure what the Flagger was doing as he sat in the Shadow Vehicle,12
"One flagger was distracted by their phone while performing duties in the roadway. I informed the flagger of the hazard, and it was corrected.",12
The crew is off loading mats from a flat bed truck in the roadway of a neighborhood at a 3 way intersection utilizing a traffic lane. There was one flagger on foot and another in a truck. It was decided there were not enough flaggers in place to complete the task safely protecting the public and crew. The crew stopped work and moved to a different location.,12
Flagger forgot to check passenger side of truck before getting in and moving vehicle. We later discussed importance of checking around entire surroundings before moving,12
"Parked in the road without Flagger being in position yet, this was a lower traffic area but still should have waited for Flagger to get into position",12
I coached on need for an advanced warning sign needed around blind curve in southbound lane and need to call for a replacement for flagger that went home early,12
"[NAME] buffer and not enough cone in taper and flagger not wearing vest, talked with them about taper and buffer, ask flagger to put a vest on.",12
Employee flagging within the taper. Coached employee on proper flagging set up and having the flagger set up in the sun to make him more visible. discussed with the crew on pre job planning to better identify flagger locations.,12
Buffer zones well short of standards; Signs too close together but too far from the actual work zone; flaggers not visible from flagger symbol sign; Flaggers too far from tapers and one with unsafe escape path ( stone retaining wall ); ' End [NAME] ' sign blocking VDOT sign indicating max speed for sharp curve. Deficiencies corrected at site.,12
WAP sign - flagger sign was set up on the wrong side of an intersection which allowed traffic to enter into the WAP Zone without any visual aides. Corrected by flagging crew supervisor.,12
Missing Prepare Stop Ahead sign on one end ( GF left and retrieved one ). Distance from Flagger Symbol to flagger too far on the 55 mph curvy country road ( GF left and retrieved another Flagger Symbol to place closer to flagger. No shadow vehicle on the road ( GF instructed to use one of their pickups ).,12
"[NAME] was setup with work area, one lane and flagger behind truck. Only work area and one lane in front. [NAME] was not going to flag road in an area where flagger should be used. Did not have buffer or taper setup properly.",12
Flagger at back of Jiraffe did not have Stop / Slow paddles. Flagging crew was relocating at the time to detour traffic around work zone.,12
One flagger out of the two flagging stations did not have their class 3 leg gaiters on per Asplundh policy.,12
"Road Safe Flagger was set up in a blind sided curve flagging traffic with his stop and go paddle, with No out to separate his self from on coming traffic,.",12
[NAME] flagging state route with no radio communication. Had flagged in the work zone on the wrong side of road so he could have visual sight of the other flagger - which in turn left three lifts with booms grounded because they could not pull up far enough to trim the trees needing worked. Buffer area on state route was obsolete. Transitioned from workspace behind chipper right into the taper. No cushion at all. Terrible setup at the way around.,12
1. Traffic advanced warning signs were miles before the work zone. 2. One lane closed tapper with cones was too tight. Cones needed more spaced out. [NAME] MUTCD - OHIO DOT for correct spacing. 3. One Flagger for the one lane closed. Motorists driving did not slow or stop until at Flagger in front of work area. Motorist should be stopped / slowed at tapper. Note: This was a temporary closer prior to a full duration one lane closer with AFAD.,12
Coming out of a busy intersection the taper zone was about 5 foot from the back of their truck. The line foreman was asked to move his truck to allow the flaggers to accommodate a longer taper zone but they did not comply. The flagger was flagging from inside the short taper zone. Problem was remedied once the crew moved to the next pole and the work zone had to be moved. The crew foreman said he would be in contact with their manager to request a different crew for the next day.,12
"Job briefing was not presented to me upon my arrival at the work site. After requesting to be briefed upon the setup and work place hazards, I then realized that the employee failed to list the proper controls needed for the WAP Zone. Spoke with the lead flagger and tried to address the situation but there was a disconnect on what was needed to perform safely.",12
Middle flagger failed to properly communicate with crew members and released traffic while crew members were still in the roadway. Activities had to be stopped until traffic was stopped again and workers were safe to get back in roadway. Spoke to crew leader to ensure third flagger did not leave the middle of the work area. [NAME] showed poor communication and was not meeting the needs of the WAP.,12
Flaggers were not in the correct position for stopping traffic. One flagger was standing in the travel lane of the road. The other was so close to the intersection that the motorists would not be able to react if they saw him at all. Both flaggers were outside the flagger ahead sign.,12
Flagging operation had one flagger for two - way traffic. [NAME] could not see flagger standing in the shade.,12
I coached on need for effective traffic control. Flagger with AWP ( [NAME] [NAME] ) was new and needed advanced warning as there was a bend in road. Other flagger had went home sick and he was trying to direct traffic alone.,12

"Climber had pruner hanging in the tree near the base of the ground, not aloft with him where it could be obtained if needed. All stop was called and I advised the groundman to tie the pruner onto the climbers rope and had him pull it up to working height so it could be utilized if needed. Climber expressed his concern of being liable if the pruner was to fall and damage anything below the tree, I suggested hanging the pruner on a nearby limb if he was not comfortable with securing it to his climbing saddle. This opened up discussion between him and his supervision to look into a more secure way to attach the pruner to the climber in the future.",14

Although the line was deenergized and grounded both trees should have been trimmed individually from two different tie in points to avoid splitting phases with climbing line.",14
trimmer was utilizing a pruning pole with 3 sections while in the tree. We discussed the rule of a max of 2 poles while aloft and had the trimmer remove one section. This is a control issue not allowed when able to contact a powerline.,14
Stopper knot was not tied in originally while setting the rope and while the trimmer was ascending the tree for pruning. [NAME] was coached and stopper knot was tied in accordingly due to trimmer being approximately 85 aloft.,14

[NAME] did not use rope and did not use notch when felling tree. [NAME] did a break cut then pushed it over.,14
"While observing trimmer aloft, for 30 minutes trimming tree, opportunity to remind climber to secure in before making his next cut. climbers response was thank you for the reminder as he had gotten out of rythm and forgot to secure in for the next cut.",14
"Employee was doing an outstanding job of practicing the safe utilization of escape routes from the work area while tree felling. However, tree feller was observed running down a rutted out road with the bar forward after setting the hinge wood. Spoke with tree feller and thanked him for following the procedures, but asked him to try and not run while utilizing escape path. Spoke with employee about being aware of the dangers not only associated with the felling process but STFs.",14
Climber exited the tree in a rush due to frustration over lack of observer. Almost hit fence and could have become entangled in climb line.,14
The final tree was a dead [NAME]. There was no documentation about the hazards associated with cutting dead limbs.,14
"As one of the employees started to descend form the tree, i had him show me the end of his climb line and a stopper knot was not placed in it before ascending to do the work. we discussed this and the foreman had a coaching moment with the employee.",14
Trimmer was tied in around a spar not the main leader of the tree. After observed the [NAME] had the crew member readjust the tie in point.,14
Employee packed the tools and material over the downed tree branches instead of going around which provided a clear path.,14
Tree crew removed one tree as tree fell it contacted other tree causing limbs to break and debris to be flying through air.,14
Tree trimmer was in a back yard away from his crew and did not have any water with him. I went to our truck and grabbed him some.,14
RD - Coached the trimmer to have climb line around the main portion of the tree. Trimmer then reset his climb line into a crotch that was around the main portion of the tree.,14
The crew had just finished cutting a tree that was beyond the AEP Tree [NAME] Policy. The policy was reviewed and discussed for understanding.,14
Jonatan cutting directly above [NAME] who was trimming directly below Jonatan. Stopped crew and explained why this was dangerous and adjustment were made by having [NAME] come down from his tree.,14
[NAME] foreman stated a dead ash tree couldn't be climbed because it was dead. Tree was a oak that was not dead.,14
"[NAME] began work under a tree that had a large broken limb above the work area. The crew did not identify the hazard or note it on the briefing. After the hanger was brough to the crew's attention, they removed it from the tree.",14
Climber descended the tree without removing his gaffs and proceeded to walk in the ROW without removing them.,14
[NAME] tree had come down. Tree trimmers cleared the tree but had left debris. Groundman were walking through and stepping over tree limbs,14
RB - upper section of boom making contact with neutral. The [NAME] spotting was aware that the boom was inside of mad and did not call all stop. Stopped work and the crew finished the tree with a 3 stick pruner.,14
"RD - [NAME] failed to identify tree parts growing in MAD, also didn't have a mitigation plan for the hazard",14
"Trimmer was limbing a 90 - foot yellow poplar tree at the edge of a cow pasture from a 60 / 70 bucket. There was a fence below in the drop zone. The trimmer cut a large limb that drifted towards the fence. The foreman then communicated to the trimmer that he needed to rope the limbs out to avoid them hitting any targets below. The trimmer roped the next limb but must have not rigged it correctly because the limb free - fell and contacted the fence, requiring it to be repaired.",14
"Employee cut through the heart of the tree and completely past where the designated apex would be while performing a double pac - man notch with a 24 "" "" bar. The [NAME] tree was approximately 26 "" "" s at the stump. The employee cut through all of the hinge wood while the 24' bar came out of both sides of the stump and left only approximately 4 "" "" s to perform a back cut on. Very dangerous situation due to the weight of the spar setting the saw, the potential for the tree to splinter up and and break off of the stump, tree feller may not be able to clear the tree to a safe distance and / or the spar could've went towards the energized conductors. Rigging crew was able to set and crank the spar to fell away from the tree feller and 3 - phase conductors in a safe manner. Spoke directly with all three foremen in the work zone and spoke with the tree feller as well on appropriate notch / back cut and tree felling procedures.",14
This crew with assistance from a manual / chipping crew was setting a rope before felling a tall tree near roadway. Rope was secured to small pine that was well within 1 1 / 2 tree height. Two Foremen were then holding the same rope while standing just a couple of feet behind the small pine. Foremen stated the plan was to pull the tree after the back cut to ensure it fell away from the road then run from the area. [NAME] stated they were aware of the 1 1 / 2 times distance but that sometimes you have to work different to keep it out of the road. I then pointed out that the rope probably would not allow them the 1 1 / 2 distance required anyway and that the tree would obviously fall into trees behind it and not reach the ground. [NAME] developed new plan to use bucket to top tree then fell the stub.,14
Employee did not let the rope tenders to crank the tree over as per policy. The tree feller kept cutting through the hinge wood to get it started in the felling direction. Tree feller did not get to the 15 - 25' safe distance from the stump to allow the rope tenders crank the tree over. [NAME] failed to keep his eyes on the task and was rushing during the tree felling process. Addressed with the foreman immediately after observation.,14
[NAME] parked near a dead tree. They were asked to move to a better parking spot and the GF was notified,14
[NAME] members were doing some task that wasn't liste to them. A climber was in a tree and he was not listed as a climber.,14
"[NAME] had already started on their task when I arrived, I got a briefing from [NAME] on everything they covered with him. [NAME] from observation alone I could tell the tree crew were following all guidelines",14
"[NAME] removed a tree in the direction of an employee aloft, also one employee wasn't pulling the rope and wasn't two times the height of the tree away.",14
"[NAME] members had moved to a new location from which they had previously been assisting a mini - bucket truck crew with cleanup and failed to add tree felling, roping and other associated hazards / mitigations. Helped foreman document and review job - briefing updates with the crew members prior to starting task.",14
"Trimmer cut branch out of boxelder tree that brushed the communication lines pretty heavily on its way down, causing poles and facilities to shake. GF coached crew on ensuring branches have safe clearance from all facilities present and that such a situation could potentially cause an outage.",14
"put notch in tree before clearing out escape route, this caused other employees to inside danger zone",14
RD - tree growing into conductor and needed to get a pruner from the truck before removing from the ground with non conductive tool.,14
Command and response was not properly addressed during the work process of felling trees. Tree feller failed to clear and ensure all work members were out of the fell zone prior to starting the notch.,14
RD line of fire - Groundman retrieved hangers in tree left by trimmer but was inside of the drop zone while another trimmer was still trimming in the adjacent tree.,14
[NAME] completed the bucket trim and moved on to manually climbing a tree and did not change job briefing.,14
[NAME] set up rope puller well inside the danger zone. We stopped the crew and explained the policy of being a length and a half away from the tree when removing.,14
Bought extra chaps for crews because there was a lot of tree trimming needed to be cut. Did not cut any bigger than 6 inch. We left the big stuff to all tree crews.,14

Tree crew working under build distribution line under 69Kv transmission line. No documentation on the job briefing about the 69 line.,14
"RD - climber was tied into an adjacent tree, as the trimmer was climbing the tree that needed trimmed the employees climb line was stuck on a lower limb of the tree he was tied into. This caused the climbing line to make a U shape. If the employee would be to fall he would free fall 4 ft then swing back into the he was tied into. Coached the trimmer to tend the slack in the line and to keep the line higher than his attachment point of his saddle.",14
The need to use more positive control. [NAME] were dropping limbs on smaller unmarked tree and garage. [NAME] understood importance and will continue to improve.,14
[NAME] failed to ensure all members of the crew were clear prior to tree feller performing the notch.,14
crew was tasked to climb and trim tree. I asked crew if they had another saddle and rope for rescue in case trimmer got into trouble. They said they did back at the truck. I advised them before anymore work was done to get the extra climbing gear on the R / W.,14
Climber failed to identify his climb line was on a dead stub. As the climber started to ascend the tree the dead stub broke and the climber dropped approx 1 foot.,14
"GF gave climb crew a perfect bucket tree, bucket crew was in the area and would have been a much better choice for the tree that caused the outage",14
[NAME] was rushing to restart tree removals and failed to set cones back up in taper / buffer which could have led to potential line of fire hazards.,14
"crew did not wait for feller to exit escape route before pulling over the tree, discussed with GF and crew",14
VWP showed multiple locations instead of just 1 location for work. Confusing to tree crews when work is identifed in multiple locations and placed on VWP. A VWP should be made for each separte location. great opportujtuy for tree crew to interact with workplanner and ask for clarification.,14
tree cutters were in the process of cutting some tree for R / W. it was our choice to remain out of the line of fire until after all trees were on the ground,14
A two man crew was performing tree felling operations that required a three man crew to perform safely and reliably.,14
"[NAME] did not have sufficient communication between the feller and other employee. The feller did not leave enough hinge wood and allowed tree to "" "" free fall "" "" without having the employee with the rope to pull.",14
[NAME] only utilized one rope while felling the large diameter Buckeye. Tree had a slight lean and are notorious to not hinge well and possibly break and fall parallel to the lines. Spoke with foreman about utilizing two ropes while cutting Buckeyes when approximate and addressing specific issues on the job briefing in the future.,14
Aep crew informed tree crew to not pull to hard on open wire vines since single phase poles are old and could possibly knock down primary wire.,14
TREE DOWN WIRE BROKEN SINGLE PHASE LINE GROUNDED AT FUSE POLE BUR THE REISER WAS NOT LIFTED AND LINE SHOULD OF BEEN BOX GROUNDED FOR TREE TRIMMERS,14
"The crew leader of the bucket truck, who was acting as lead foreman, chose to put climbers in a tree that AEP Forestry deemed to risky to climb. The crew had 60 % of this tree complete when they were observed. Previously Forestry shut down a climber who was going to climb this tree. GF and Forestry agreed that equipment could reach the tree and climber were not to do job. The foreman disregarded this and chose to put his crew at unnecessary risk. Forestry pulled the climbers out of the tree. And GF will get equipment to TOR to finish removal.",14
Bucket operator moved from one driveway to another driveway to finish trimming a tree. [NAME] did not put a sign out at the end of the driveway. I asked what constitutes a work zone and as they were answering they figured it out.,14
"SIF Electrical, RB, two buckets split phases to access the tree. [NAME] approach was not maintained.",14
Chipper left running while all crew members were engaged in the tree felling. GF shut the machine off and removed the key,14
"Very muddy and wet conditions also right away cut, trimmers left tree studs sticking out ground 3 to a foot",14
[NAME] person was standing in ROW while foreman was cutting tree of line. Stopped and asked him to move off to the side out of line of fire.,14
CLIMBER ATTACHED RUNNING CHAINSAW TO SADDLE AND THEN MOVED POSTIONS IN THE TREE. CLIBMER SHOULD HAVE TURNED SAW OFF.,14
One crew member climbing tree should have repositioned himself before cutting limb close to his leg. No fall zone was set up,14
[NAME] on rope was pulling down tree before cutter was able to utilize escape route. [NAME] understood the importance of escape route for cutter and will continue to improve.,14
RD - Trimmer didn't have a stopper knot at the end of his rope. Trimmer also came down out of the tree with his spurs still on.,14
Command and response was not documented on the job - brief and not properly used during a tree felling task. Employee called out for the notch but did not turn off the saw and ask for an all clear after the notch and prior to the back - cut.,14
RD - when the crew cut the tree off the communication line the release of energy caused the log fly into the air. Coached the crew about controlling the wood and the wires.,14
"[NAME] was able to park the bucket off the main street, however the tree they were trimming was near the roadway. They did not have a sign on the main street, however due to the wind, limbs fell close to the roadway.",14
[NAME] observed two - stepping a 30 beech with a 20 bar on a steep embankment. When the sawyer went to the bad side of the tree he was observed holding the saw above the shoulder with the nuts up to be able to reach in and make the downstream side of the notch. Addressed to the crew members and GF that a saw with a big bar should be available as needed to safely make all cuts when needed from the good side of the tree.,14
"RC - observed trimmer flying bucket between primary and neutral while trimming. From the ground the employee seemed to be able to maintain MAD on both primary and neutral. After talking with the trimmer, he agreed that he would have been able to trim the tree by going over the lines and it was not necessary to go between primary and neutral.",14
[NAME] member who was performing tree felling procedures was observed drop starting chainsaw. Spoke with crew member to translate to foreman and to utilize safe procedures in the future.,14
Trimmer did a very good job felling the tree however he did not fully use his exit escape route. This at risk behavior was reviewed with trimmer and foreman. Trimmer committed to being more aggressive when proceeding out the escape route.,14
I coached the employees about the trees that were cut down by tree trimmers the could be a potential tripping hazard.,14
"[NAME] hat was observed using fiberglass pruner to trim side of tree with 4 extensions in it, he had the single phase to his back. [NAME] had the fifth extension on the ground and the grass was wet. I had a discussion with him abut keeping his insulated tools up off the ground and to keep them dry as possible. The next discussion we had was over time that extension pruner gets heavy and awkward with four extension in it, we all agreed that if 3 extensions couldn't do the job that a trimmer needed to get in the tree and perform the work tasks safely, so we don't lose control over the extension pruner and it goes into the primary.",14
RD - Employee was roping a tree top to be removed. During the back cut the trimmers chainsaw ran out of gas. Coached the employees to make sure and peer check making sure all equipment is ready for work before starting a high risk task.,14
[NAME] ended up breaking off a large limb off of a tree that they hit with the bucket truck and cause significant damage to tree.,14
Employee LMC went aloft to trim tree and prior to making contact with the tree LCL stopped employee an had him come down a put on his rubber gloves.,14
"I watched as the Arborist was felling a 12 inch DBH tree. As he made his back cut he failed to use his escape route and exit before the tree started to fall. I stopped the crew before they started on the second tree to be felled, and tried to explain the issue. We went over stopping at 10 % hinge wood and letting the crew pull the tree over. The foreman and I spoke about not pulling with rigging too much so it stayed put until he exited from the fall zone. They actually pulled harder this next rigging. I called an all stop and we discussed releasing most of the rigging tension, since the tree was small and straight. They adjusted the rigging. But once again the saw operator did not leave the location as the tree fell, just moving slightly to the side.",14
[NAME] failed to do a proper hazardous tree assessment and did not notice how badly the base of this co dominant dead tree was.,14
"crew cutting log that had powerline pinned down over downed line in the line of fire ( crew gf was informed and stopped crew ). crew touched limbs that were laying on lines. poor escape route when trimming tree stump, in a narrow corridor between logs in the path of log roll.",14
Climber was setup in tree and didn't have safety glasses on at all while trimming the tree. I stopped and made sure the crew got the trimmer safety glasses so he could perform his duties safely.,14
"This jobsite had two crews with nine total employees on site, one employee was climbing all others were on the ground standing around with one employee roping the tree that was cut in the direction of the trimmer.",14
"RC. [NAME] was chunking down a tree that was marked for removal. The crew roped the top portion of the tree that consisted of two large leads. The trimmer made his cut before the leads split, and the top portion fell uncontrolled getting hung up on surrounding trees. The crew acknowledged the issue and had a conversation on the matter. As the crew continued to chunk down the tree, the trimmer was making his back cuts through the hinge. This was putting the trimmer in the line of fire. [NAME] was also coached of this hazard. GF was notified and stated he would have a re - training on the concerns.",14
The fell zone was only marked at one times the distance and not at 1 - 1 / 2 times the height of the tree. The tip of the tree fell right at the flagging which does not meet the requirements of a proper fell zone. [NAME] members were not in danger of being within the fell zone and the necessary communications were agreed upon moving forward.,14
"2 - people on the pick up. The passenger did not get out to assist the driver. They was in tight location that had a steel street light pole along with other distractions, tree branches, curb",14
Alot of tree debris in the yard. Removing all the debris in his path would have taken a long time so he worked around it safely.,14
Groundman was observed moving a DZ flag closer to the tree as the trimmer was trimming so that he would be able drag brush as the trimmer was trimming. also observed the groundman entering the truck as the trimmer was trimming.,14
RD - employee did not inspect his work positioning lanyard before ascending the tree. The lanyard had multiple cuts and was taken out of service.,14
"Employee stated that he has never witnessed anyone on a tree crew reviewing a chainsaw manual, nor had he done so himself.",14
"The first limb up the tree which the climber cut, was longer in length then the height up the tree which the climber had reached. The climber failed to recognize the hazard by not removing some of the length of the limb. By not doing this, when the limb was cut the tip of the limb hit the ground and the butt end sprung back at him in the tree. Luckily the butt end of the limb hit the center of the tree and not the climber - therefore no potential injury was sustained. Spoke with the GF about the incident during the observation, to ensure steps are taken that all limbs are cut in a manner which they clear the tree and safely land in the Drop Zone.",14
RD - Trimmer tied into the tree at the base instead of tying into a crotch or using an adjustable false crotch. [NAME] member was asked to fix his tie in. All employees were coached on the correct methods of climbing.,14
Outrigger was on the outrigger pad that was sideway on a stump. [NAME] were asked to reposition the bucket to finish the tree.,14
[NAME] members with rope did not wait on the command from the feller that he was all clear and for the crew to pull. I called an all stop and communicated the importance of waiting for the all clear from the feller before the crew pulled the tree.,14
RD - Coached trimmer on using escape rt during tree felling. [NAME] also had to coach on the trimmers poor notch and back cut,14
Observed tree trimming employee who was working from a MEWP. [NAME] had a harness on but no retractable lanyard.,14
"[NAME] felling tall, thin Poplar with crew member on pull rope. [NAME] cut too much into the hinge and the tree began to fell. [NAME] slow to identify tree began to fell and continued sawing. Once he realized, sawyer took three steps that were parallel with the felling tree before walking away at an angle. I explained the concern to the GF for him to interpret to the crew.",14
[NAME] closed sign was hidden behind a tree and difficult to see. You had to be looking for the sign to find it. Moved the sign out and away from the tree for clear line of site.,14
Bucket sawyer used boom to push large block of wood off tree after performing snap cut. Stated he knew better but trying to save his back from attempting to push it over. I recommended roping or cutting smaller blocks.,14
"Tree crew began trimming a tree directly over a public vehicle, dropping branches on the vehicle in the process. I stopped the work and told them to try to get the vehicle moved. Nobody answered the door, so they moved to another set up.",14
Trimmer was removing branch overhanging single phase. It was to be tip tied and pulled back away from primary. The trimmer made his notch on the side of the branch instead of on the top of the branch causing it to swing improperly and brushing the phase in the process. This was discussed after the tree was completed.,14
"[NAME] created a line of fire situation along with potential for tree being felled to hit lines due to poor planning, hazard tree assessment and rushing.",14
"After the crew fell the tree on a hill side and was beginning to cut the log into firewood, coached the crew to position themselves out of the line of fire and be aware of the log shifting as they began cutting.",14
Three company issued drop zone cones were set out before felling pine tree but they were setup for typical drip edge plus of the tree. I coached GF and he in turn reminded / demonstrated the stick method for determining fell zones. The cones were subsequently moved to two times the height of the tree.,14
Two trimmers aloft in tree within close proximity ( 4 - 5' ) to one another. One trimmer was roughly 10 - 15' higher than the other making cuts while the other was below in a direct path of debris.,14
The crew was working in the right - of - way. the location of their truck forces them to walk through an area were a tree had fallen and presented a high risk of tripping and falling.,14
Employee failed to remove his spikes and walked approximately 30 or more to an area where the trimmer took a break. Addressed to the trimmer and GF about ensuring that spikes should be removed at the base of the tree prior to walking away from the tree due to associated STF hazards.,14
Climber did not have gloves while in the tree. Climber had to ask for a pair of gloves while in the tree. All crew members were coached on having the correct PPE before performing tasks.,14
Command and response was observed being utilized during each tree felling process. Three way communication was listed on the job briefing but specific commands were not listed. Spoke with the foreman to ask if they would be willing to add command and response moving forward.,14
The crew just added the new location to the briefing. It was not site specific. They went from normal tree removal to a storm tree job. They did not have any new information regarding the dangers in front of them.,14
"CREW NEEDED COACHED THROUGH CLEARANCES AND SHOWN THINGS THEY MISSED WHILE I WAS PRESENT ON JOBSITE. FAILED TO RECOGNIZE TREE SPECIES, POOR CUTS, AND BRUSH NOT SPRAYED.",14
"LSR6 RD [NAME] finished up trimming one tree and repositioned the truck and started trimming on another tree and did not establish a drop zone, spotter could have placed himself in the line of fire. SIF Stored Energy spotter placed himself in the line of fire by standing under a 3 phase while trimming was being done in close proximity to conductor.",14
Tree was hanging over primary. Line crew was called to shut off line and ground making worksite safe.,14
"An assessment had been done prior to climbing, however the crew was unsure as to what specific type of tree one of the trees were that they were climbing. Addressed at the time of the observation.",14
Truck was set up very close to tree being trimmed / we had a concern for the falling limbs possibly hitting the truck.,14
The biggest saw that the crew had available was a 20 bar. The bar didnt allow the tree feller to even safely two step the notch and back cut. Tree feller had to return to the danger side of the tree during back cut which creates an unneeded risk. Spoke with the foreman and GF about ensuring the crew was properly equipped to safely remove DBX / DXW trees.,14
"Bucket truck was right next to large tree when crew fell the tree, truck within 7' from tree trunk. [NAME] did make sure he had an escape route.",14
"Climber had climb line in the tree and needed to reposition the rope in the tree so the climber could climb the backside of the tree. In order for the climber to reposition the rope, he would be putting pressure on a dead limb in the tree. Talked with he climber and the crew to stay clear of the tree until the climb line is in a safe location.",14
I mark this as at risk because of what I mentioned earlier about the tree crew planning to hold the line down.,14
Tree trimming policy not followed. Trimming a tree that was to large. [NAME] stopped and professional trimmers called in. Follow up about policy adherence was given to AEP S & H Contractor Manager.,14
[NAME] was not detailed when describing their job. Simply putting down you will be trimming the tree is not detailed enough. I spoke with the crew about this and they promised to make more of an effort to specifically describe how they will trim the tree to the best of their ability.,14
[NAME] did not use the best options for pulling the top out of a pine tree. Especially with limited manpower. Only one groundman was attempting to pull the top over while being cut. The top actually sat back the opposite way and the back - cut closed up on the saw.,14
[NAME] needs to make sure tree debris thrown into corn fields is pick up. Could possible damage landowner equipment.,14
One climber did not perform collar cuts while ascending and instead left longer cut branches which could pose significant hazards if cut out from tree.,14
Bought extra chaps for crews because there was a lot of tree trimming needed to be cut. Did not cut any bigger than 6 inch. We left the big stuff to all tree crews.,14
"[NAME] did not use a method to determine tree height or fall zone ( guessed ) also did not reset fall zone which put crew working inside original zone while cutting smaller tree, coached on issues",14
"Danger zone was not documented on the briefing, and the specific command and response that these crews use while felling a tree.",14
"Tree trimmers cutting very large tree, were working hard to make sure to make the right cuts. unsure of what could go wrong due to so many unseen issues.",14
Bought extra chaps for crews because there was a lot of tree trimming needed to be cut. Did not cut any bigger than 6 inch. We left the big stuff to all tree crews.,14
The crew never cleared the debris from the tree being removed. So when the climbers came out of the tree they had to navigate over and around large tree limbs and debris. They had plenty of help to stop periodically and stack and clear a clean work zone. Noticed three crew members sitting down and talking at site.,14
[NAME] was working next to the broken pole while tree crews were trying to remove the tree from the wire that was down. The wire and pole were still under tension.,14
[NAME] member agreed he was in a comprised position could of use a different tool to eliminate hazard. Needs handsaw any time climbing and cutting in tree ( fixed ),14
"Employees were cutting leads off of a red - oak to lighten the spar to pull it off of a stump and let it descend down the bank to a safe resting location. The tree was pulled over whole, therefore causing a lot of stored energy in the sping - wood created by having all the leads and limbs left in it. Spoke with the foreman about his decision to not top the tree and remove a lot of the weight prior to felling the tree and eliminating the stored energy on the ground.",14
[NAME] was felling dead pines when I arrived. There was a ~10' strip of brush on edge of right of way at base of trees they were removing. Rope kept getting caught up in brush causing the tree to shake. Also could impede escape routes. I instructed general foreman to cut brush back to timberline before removing any more pines to make the job safer. [NAME] agreed this would be safer and stopped job of tree felling until brush could be cut.,14
"CREW HAD 2 CLIMBERS IN THE TREE, I DID NOT SEE A 3RD SADDLE AND ROPE IN CASE THEY NEEDED IT FOR A RESCUE.",14
"[NAME] was up in the tree and [NAME] was coaching [NAME] on how to move about the tree while moving down in the tree to make more cuts, while he had the line set and tied in he undid his buck straps to move down and he slipped. From what I saw [NAME] then fell and tried to grab the tree but couldn't get hold and fell to the ground. This distance was about 20 feet or so. after shawn was seen to and he was okay, with pain in his hip and shoulder, the crew said that the blakes hitch was used and had failed in some way either it opened up and didn't catch him or [NAME] may have paniced and grabbed the knot and inadvertandly held onto it so it couldn't catch and stop him. after [NAME] was seen to and he walked to the truck on his own we stayed near him and just made sure he was ok.",14
Used escape route towards notch due to limited escape route. tree could of been pieced down to eliminate felling,14
Command and response was not specifically documented on the job - briefing at the time of the observation. [NAME] called an all stop and documented / reviewed with the other crew members each command and response for tree felling procedures.,14
With better communication and work plan crew could of possibly utilized bucket or climbed tree to cut instead of piecing 7 extentions of a pruner to cut. [NAME] a post job meeting with ATE about planning and ergonimocs for employes to be safer,14
Two crew members operating winch were less than required 1 1 / 2 times tree height. [NAME] stated they were okay because tree was being cut to fall away from them. I explained 1 1 / 2 times was required in 360 degrees of tree. [NAME] understood and repositioned winch with tree out of the zone.,14
Climber attempted to climb a larger diameter tree. His climb line was in an awkward low position. The climber worked extremely hard to pull himself up using his climb line. I asked the climber why he chose that spot instead of something higher. His concern was speed. After asking the climber to come out of the tree he repositioned his climb line in a higher crotch which allowed him to use less energy to climb the tree.,14
[NAME] Erosa stated he used one of his work positioning lanyard to pull over tree. Explained to him that his work positioning lanyard was not to be used for tree felling. This was discussed with Project Manager [NAME] [NAME].,14
"Climber left one limb on the uphill side of the first section of the tree to be chunked down after the top had been removed. When the trimmer back - cut the chunk, the weight of the limb caused the chunk to fell in an unforseen manner and hit the trimmer upper chest / neck area. The trimmer was not hurt, but should only leave limbs if the section is going to be felled in that specific direction - "" "" away from the trimmer "" "" - to eliminate a potential line of fire injury. Spoke with the observer at the time of the incident.",14
[NAME] was using rope come along and had too much tension on the tree. Once the feller started his back cut the tree started falling not allowing the feller to leave via escape route in time before the crew started ratcheting the come along and pulling the tree. Called an all stop and talked with the crew on the need of not putting so much tension on the tree to allow the feller time to leave the area before the tree starts falling.,14
"[NAME] was removing a small dead ash and it was split into two sections with another small live tree in the middle of it. Come to fine out that when they made a cut on the live tree to get it out of the way, it wa s actually holding the dead ash upright. Nobody was hurt, they were able to let the tree fall safely and a near miss report was going to filled out.",14
[NAME] was working on steep hill side. Requested crew to put hand line in tree to assist in climbing hill.,14
"[NAME] foreman had just cut approx 4in DBH / 25ft tall tree on uphill side of single phase line without a rope when the tree could have easily contacted the line had it gotten out of control. I immediately went to his general foreman and told him to address the issue. The supervisor was then contacted as well about the issue. The next day, the crew foreman was issued a written performance notice by the GF.",14
Bought extra chaps for crews because there was a lot of tree trimming needed to be cut. Did not cut any bigger than 6 inch. We left the big stuff to all tree crews.,14
"RC - SIF LOF - when felling tree, the feller did not leave enough hinge wood and began to fall before the feller was able to use his escape route.",14
[NAME] failed to notice a tree stump and pipe sticking out of the ground near the work location. Placed cones over the hazards and communicated what i found to the crew.,14
Misunderstanding of required grounding needed at this location to provide proper protection. Stopped job and had discussion with tree crew and line crew to make safe before continuing on,14
[NAME] failed to set up a Drop Zone prior to removing the leads and upper trunk section. Climber was also observed not utilizing a break cut or notch on two occasions which allowed the large limbs to rip instead of falling horizontally. By allowing the limbs to rip could potentially pull the climber into to the tree and into harms way. Spoke with GF and addressed all issues which were observed.,14
Climber free climbed 10 - 12 ft into tree without being tied in and only did so after foreman told him. Later he was observed with his climbing line & buckstrap unhooked from climbing gear. Was then informed by AEP supervisor that he had to be tied in.,14
Climb line was falling off branch on spruce tree. It was not close to crotch or trunk of tree. Climber fixed the climb line. [NAME] need to recognize this issue. Climb line needed a stopper knot at the end. Fixed and crews committed to improving. Pole pruner needed out on job site when climbing. Fixed after discussion.,14
Pulled up on job and employee was up in bucket on main line between the fiber and the neutral. Pole was leaning and the lateral had a tree down on the primary and secondary. The fuse was open on the lateral. The mainline was hot and because the pole was leaning the primary and secondary were in the tree limbs. I noticed the primary and secondary burning the limbs.,14
"Business partner has a tree felling policy in place but crew did not meet all of the requirements due to not having a 360 fell zone at 1 - 1 / 2 times during the first tree felling procedure which was observed. Spoke with the foreman and had issue corrected immediately. Rope tenders had too much tension on the static rope and pulled the tree through the holding wood prior to the tree feller being able to escape far enough away. When the tree being felled hit the ground, it broke hinge and jumped off of the stump without incident - fortunately.",14
Spoke with [NAME] about walking around with his gaffs on. [NAME] members need to remove gaffs after descending tree and moving to the next tree.,14
"RD - during the tree felling, as the crew was attempting to pull the tree over, a limb that the hand line was wrapped around broke causing slack in the pull rope. This caused the tree to set back down on the stump falling back towards the lines. Since the sawyer made a good notch and back cut this prevented the tree from causing an outage. After a post job brief it was agreed upon that the crew should have took additional time when setting the hand line and picked a more suitable crotch for the tree felling.",14
The crew had the Reclosure on HTLnand the primary they were moving was touching tree limbs. I called an all stop to have the crew install hose where the phase was making contact with the tree limbs.,14
[NAME] air mailed the old cross arm without utilizing a hand line. Ground man was back but was there was a Walnut tree with dead limbs that couldve been broken out and potentially struck the employee. AEP safety addressed it to the GF and addressed it to all of the crew members.,14
crew was preparing to fell tree ( at a 45 degree angle from the line in the direction of a main State Route ) with the tree possibly hitting the road.,14
"Asplundh [NAME] was felling a tree and did not get out of the danger zone before the tree fell. After talking with the [NAME], he was not familiar with the 5 steps of tree felling and tree felling policy.",14
"RC. During a planned outage, the crew planned on rigging down a large section of a tree leaning over the line. The crew attached a tagline, but right before the cut was made decided not to use it. The crew then began to make a large cut ( Roughly 6' ) and did not manage the fall as they planned. The debris drug along the primary and bounced off the secondary.",14
[NAME] called for Groundman to come along the tree over prematurely. [NAME] was told by GF to completely exit the danger zone and Groundman finished cranking the tree over.,14
Top trimmer tied his climbing line around a cluster of suckers and not the main trunk. Stopped the trimmer and had him tie in properly. Climber chose a tie in spot so low in the tree to where he was placing his body in awkward position to prune tree. GF had trimmer tie in high to properly trim tree.,14
"The crew did not do a good job on this. They had cut two large trees down already on this day and were on the third and final tree. All the saws had dull chains. A foreman started notching the tree then stopped to sharpen the chain. Another crew member then went up and finished the notching. They used a conventional notch instead of an open face notch. On the back cut, the saw was so dull that it started curving up on the back cut not leaving a proper hinge. The two guys pulling the rope struggled getting the tree to fall. Done correctly, it should have broke over easily at the hinge. While cutting, a crew member blew the whistle to try to get the cutter to stop but he could not hear him. They said after wards they were worried about a service line to the side of the direction the tree was to fall.",14
Trees were in the way of new ROW. [NAME] cut down trees. After job was completed in post job we met and discussed tree trimming policy and sizes of diameter that can be cut.,14
[NAME] failed to identify potential widow maker in tree line near where transformer was being cleaned up.,14
Tree feller was coached on notching tree. The employees notch was not greater than 70 *. The employee cut 2 inches bellow apex on the back side of stub. Talked with the employee to monitor his notch throughout the cutting process and to stop and re - asses the cut. The tree feller noted that the saws bar was bent causing crooked cut. Coached employee to stop and fix / get a different saw to complete the job safely.,14

Subcontractor Personnel did not drive to either of two the medical facilities listed in the EAP. They drove to a different facility.

"This is not an immediate safety fault, but a recommendation to reduce overall operator exposure. It is noted that this crew, as other crews, have been executing large diameter DBX removals with domestic and farm / ranch grade chainsaws in lieu of professional grade equipment. Particularly, large diameter trunks are being felled and processed within the limitations ( generally, and on this site ) an MS271 type 50cc ( approx ) farm and ranch saw. It is well known that bar length selection, which implies a sufficient powerband, is an aspect of developing a 5s - tep felling plan. In particular, saws not optimized to the task increase risk exposure by decreasing the sawyer's options for work positioning in relation to the escape routes, increasing time at the periphery of the back - cut ( thus exposure in the immediate barberchair / butt kickback potential area ), increasing the likelihood of kerf misalignment due to the need to wrap around, and increasing heat transfer to the working components during a vital point of performance. Insufficient bar length and sufficient, but not optimized power bands increase the difficulty for the sawyer, especially those less experience, in creating the face cut architecture. Extended dwell times during debris processing also increase exposure rates while increasing T & M costs. [NAME] uppercanopy branches are currently serviced with domestic grade equipment, and while posing a different operational consideration, some points related to control, heat, and exposure time apply. It is recommended that equipment fielding be assessed and equipment, such as professional grade chainsaws, be fielded in support of large removal operations in a manner similar to commercial, municipal, and federal tree professionals in similar operating environments executing similar tasks.",29

AEP Safety asked the foreman to use his vehicle as a visible traffic barrier on one end well the more larger vehicle was taken to the other end where traffic was speeding through the work zone. This issue is being noted on the line observation because the foreman shouldve recognized his hazard. Instead of having his vehicle pulled off to the side not in use, AEP Safety requested it as another buffer for safety in the work zone.",35
"Utilized additional cones on rural road with low volume traffic, and short term work in place of proper signage. Discussed with [NAME] and crew.",35
While working in the alley the bucket was sitting on the street. [NAME] to no traffic on the street but I explained to the crew that we still needed to cone off the bucket.,35

Truck was set up along State Route 43 about 5' off road way. Two LMC standing right behind that truck with truck traffic traveling by at 55 - 60. Got the attention of both employees and showed them from a distance away how traffic was flying by them. Both said they didn't realize it and we talked about complacency.,35
1. The traffic zone set up was too far apart allowing intersecting streets and vehicles pulling out of businesses in area to pull out in the flow of on - coming traffic. The zone was adjusted for proper set up. 2. There needed to be an additional flagger to control traffic at intersecting streets. Employee called and finally a third person was added to assist. 3.

"1. ( [NAME] River ) Observed unattended bucket truck partially parked in the narrow roadway that was missing taper cones as well as signage warning traffic. Spoke with the supervisor and the truck was moved into a nearby field off of the roadway. Thank you for the quick response. 2. ( Roadsafe ) Observed 3 traffic control crew members stationed only on one end of the work zone and using their hands to stop / slow traffic. After parking, I spoke with the crew and recommended they spread out so that both ends of the work zone meet the flagging criteria and so that traffic could not drive through the work zone without the crew directing them. I also recommended that they use the stop / slow signs that are on hand so their signals are more visible. The crew immediately spread out and began utilizing the required signage.",35
[NAME] had two signs wrong and one broken sign ( difficult to see by on coming Traffic ) on a lane closure on a four lane highway,35
"[NAME] didn't have signs, cones or vest on while on the deadend roadway. A discussion was had about being visible and why we still need to use traffic control when on these types of roadways. Traffic was identified on job briefing without a mitigation plan.",35
"The crew wasn't using a flagger for this location, only allowing traffic to pass on their own with one lane open. The crew also didn't have a long enough taper to prevent traffic from hitting tree branches that were laying in front of bucket truck after the aerial cutter dropped them in the road. I asked the crew to place more cones and to watch for backed up traffic.",35
One TMI crew member was on his phone the entire time I was out there. [NAME] was not engaged and not monitoring the traffic. The other crew member was watching traffic flow.,35
No signs out and missing 1 Stop / Slow sign. Ground hands conducting traffic control as 1 lane is blocked by Grapple. GF notified.,35
"Jarraff operator did not confirm flaggers had stopped traffic before starting to trim. A mail delivery vehicle came through the work zone while jarraff was trimming small branches and did not stop, drove around and under the machine at a fairly high rate of speed. Nothing hit the vehicle but it was a failure on the operators behalf to verify traffic was stopped and it was also dangerous of the private vehicle to have kept going under the machine while it was working.",35
"When job was first set up, the traffic control was sufficient but traffic picked way up and we had to change how it was set up",35
Flaggers had a one lane road set up and were not actively flagging the work zone. The two traffic controllers were across the street in a driveway leaning on there work truck. I told the crew they needed to actively flag even though it was light traffic.,35
"While crews waiting for briefing from crew lead, they parked very close to a stop sign. This left little room for vehicles to approach safely and let oncoming traffic through. I call lead foremen and asked to have trucks moved so vehicles could safely approach stop sign.",35
"The [NAME] was coached to make sure to turn they caution lights on, on their trucks so approaching traffic could see them.",35
"Observed semi with flatbed trailer delivering JLG manlift backing onto the site from the roadway without adequate traffic control in place. Traffic was backed up in both directions due to the truck having to make a multiple point turn into the tight access. Spoke with the foreman and crew and recommended improving the line of communication with the rental company to ensure that employees can be readily available to stop traffic using the proper methods ( Signage, Stop / Slow Paddles, radio communication ) to help prevent a traffic accident / injury and accompany the driver onto site. The crew was very receptive to the coaching conversation and stated that they would reach out to the rental companies and vendors in the future to help prevent issues such as this. Thank you for the quick response.",35
I talked to the crew about hydration and traffic vests. We also talked about widow makers the storm has left after the destruction it caused.,35
[NAME] had appropriate signs and cones out but created a pinch point for passing traffic due to parked car on opposite side of street. Truck could have been moved to create better space for passing traffic.,35
Beacons and flashers wasn't working due to the Road Safe policy of crew cannot idle truck longer than 30 minutes and battery ran down couldn't even start vehicle. Now KPC has hired this company to control traffic and beacons and flashers are an important part of traffic control and those warning devices need battery power for long periods of time. Road Safe needs to come up with a different approach to saving fuel that still provides battery power to warning devices.,35
Very rural area with extremly low traffic volume. Line truck was parked blocking one side of the road with only 1 cone out and employee did not have on a traffic vest. Explained that even though there was hardly any traffic ( 1 car in an hour ) that proper cone placement and traffic vests are a layer of protection for the employees and not just a compliance issue. Not utilizing them every time can lead to eventual procedural drift. Very good conversation and engagement with coaching.,35
* Improper verbiage on the guide signs approaching the traffic control work zone. Spoke with crew leader about having appropriate signage replaced and utilized going forward. * Neither of flaggers were working inside of an indented taper at the start of the work zone.,35

They agreed that they could have put out one sign on each end of the work area to warning approaching traffic.",35
"[NAME] communication observed between the QO, and the worker aloft due to the noise of traffic and trucks running.",35
Larger jobs crews should utilize more traffic control personnel.. that includes a traffic cop. [NAME] had only two traffic control people and no officer.,35
Deficiencies with [NAME] area protection noted on call visit with traffic control contractor. Buffers and taper zones in adequate. Flaggers in improper positions.,35
"Cones and pick - up trucks were used to close down section of street. However, advanced traffic control signage was not placed out.",35
There is always a possibility of a car going off of the highway no matter where the vehicle is parked so we watched for unusual traffic.,35
Upon arrival one of the flaggers was just using his hand for traffic control and wasn't using his Stop / Slow paddle until he was asked to get it and use it. The work zone was on a low volume street at an intersection. The flagging crew did not have any signage out on one of the streets. They stated that they only had six signage stands.,35
Subcontractor WTC. On of the flaggers that was in place to stop traffic as needed did not have a Stop / Slow Paddle.,35
"Last sign in the series of three which is required to be 500' from flagman's location, was over a quarter of mile from her. This allows traffic to lose focus on looking for the flagman and generally will allow traffic to do the opposite and speed back up when the flagman is not readily visible.",35
One of the employee's was located in a blind curve with a speed limit of 55 mph non posted. I asked the employee if she could move on out the roadway to allow oncoming traffic to see her. She agreed and I gave her my phone number so I could call her when the crew was ready for them to stop traffic from both directions.,35

[NAME] coached that it is AEP policy to wear traffic vests on jobsites where heavy machinery is being operated.,35
"The LCS was going to let the bucket worker transfer conductors over the roadway without stopping traffic. The team had chose to use one form of control on the conductors instead of having two. I reminded the crew of the policy. There was a little push back, but the team finally agreed to obey my guidance. The LCS walked down to the roadway with out his vest to flag. I asked MRO supervisor on site to walk down and take his spot so he would be visible for traffic. Supervisor gave a smart remark back to the MRO supervisor about traffic not being able to see him and then walked back up to the job site. I explained it again to the LCS and moved on with the job.",35
The [NAME] was provided some coaching on the traffic control issues that were recognized when I arrived at the [NAME] Zone. Corrections were made.,35

Additional signage needed to give more advanced notice for traffic turning onto street where crews are working and have one lane closed. Some cones in need of repair of replacement of reflective tape.",35
[NAME] was setting up truck in lane of curvy two - lane rural roadway with 55 mph limit prior to flaggers setting up. [NAME] told to leave the roadway until temporary traffic zone could be setup.,35
Need right lane closer sign on [NAME] just [NAME] of SPID warning traffic right lane closer for traffic turning right off of frontage road into [NAME].,35
"The flagging team had difficulty with two vehicles showing a total disregard for the traffic set up, and running through the STOP sign being held up. These drivers caused a potential hazard to those flagging due to the on coming traffic.",35
Had one lane closed but no traffic sign alerting drivers. Did not have sufficient length of a buffer zone,35
Subcontractor [NAME] Traffic control. Traffic control was set up at a road crossing. The crew members were using red flags. They did not have stop slow paddles available. The crew was also having issues with their 2 way radios cutting in and out.,35

"Manhole was in street, talked with crew about keeping an eye on the on coming traffic and to stay within the coned off area.",35
Both Roadsafe employees were not engaged. This was brought to their attention and corrected by observer. The correction was to have a flagger one at each end of the road closer to slow down traffic and direct pedestrian traffic around the side walk closer.,35
Recommend checking right side mirror more often. This is one that is often forgotten. [NAME] stopped several times for longer periods at stop signs and alley ways to check direction and look at tickets to confirm addresses. Recommend pulling over into a parking area to do this as to not pose an issue for other traffic. Thankfully there was no other traffic during these times.,35
crew did not communicate with business about closing one of the entrances while work was being done. talked with the foreman about the importance of communicating with customers if we need to interrupt anything such as traffic flow.,35
[NAME] members were operating equipment that was blocking a lane of traffic. Flagging and signage was not in place.,35

The working vehicles were set up in the north bound lane of Reynoldsburg - [NAME] Albany Road. The section of road is two lanes with a turn lane to the west. [NAME] bound traffic was shifted into the turn lane. [NAME] bound traffic remain normal. [NAME] and lane shift signs were deployed for the north bound traffic appropriately. An arrow - board was placed in the buffer zone of the north bound lane. [NAME] north bound drivers were interpreting the set up to shift into the south bound lane and oncoming traffic. Workers monitored the situation and helped provide drivers guidance. I believe the arrow board was confusing the drivers and was unnecessary for this set up. Extending the center cones further down the road may of provide more guidance. Consider using keep right signage on the center cones for the north bound traffic.,35
Advise that vehicle when parked no matter the time he will be at the location needs to be parked facing the direction of traffic.,35

I recommended watching oncoming traffic and using the slow / stop paddles.",35
The [NAME] didnt do a good job of making sure that each direction of approaching traffic was warned of the work zone.,35
Flagger was stopping traffic standing in the middle of the road. Talked with employee and his reasoning is he cant be under the power lines when helicopter is trimming.

[NAME] was blocked by two normal traffic signs, two trash cans, a mailbox and a telephone junction box. I provided some feedback and coaching to the individual, about ensure that he can be seen by approaching traffic; not just standing where he thinks the [NAME] Zone boundary may be.

"The [NAME] was coached for not having any Warning Signs out to help warn approaching traffic that they were parked in the roadway, blocking it.",35
[NAME] moving out and TFS coming in drive path has been taken down with a lot of traffic coming in and out,35
[NAME] were working along busy hwy and did not contact the contractor WAP crew to come out and block the right lane to divert the traffic around them. [NAME] was contacted and came out to divert traffic around them while they finished the project.,35
Flagging crew had not reviewed or signed onto the JSA for the OH line crew. I recommended that they review and sign onto the JSA to have a better understanding of the hazards of the work in the traffic zone.,35
"Certain tasks needed to be expanded upon in greater detail ( i. e. traffic control, foundation installation near energized lines )",35
[NAME] did not do a good job at communicating with one another on their setup. [NAME] pulled out into the road and was working right outside their work zone. This was causing traffic confusion. Talked with the crews about the importance of communicating with one another.,35
[NAME] had a truck blocking for the truck doing the work. The location had traffic in both directions moved to one lane and the road had a slight curve prohibiting public vehicles view. Needed a team member performing traffic control and signs were added back far enough to warn drivers ahead.,35
"Both [NAME] members were sitting in the Truck talking, and not engaged in the work the Line [NAME] was doing or the traffic approaching the work zone. The [NAME] was coached that at least one person needs to be outside the truck watching approaching traffic.",35
"The [NAME] was provided some coaching, as none of the trucks had any of the Caution Lights activated. They were all parked in the roadway, and should have had their lights on to help warn approaching traffic",35
"The [NAME] had a lot of signs out warning traffic in the neighborhood of the [NAME] Zone, but they were not Flagging the traffic flowing through the [NAME] Zone. Neither Flagger had a Slow / Stop Paddle in hand and were just basically standing at each end of the [NAME] Zone. After some discussion and coaching, the [NAME] decided to shut down the north bound lane off traffic and only allow the south bound traffic to pass through the he work zone. This helped to eliminate the need to coordinate between the Flaggers. Plus, it prevented two way traffic from trying to pass through the [NAME] Zone.",35
[NAME] TC set up was for self regulate but due to amount of traffic and that this was a double yellow lined road flaggers should have been used.,35
The [NAME] ( 4 ) were not wearing Traffic [NAME] when I arrived at the job site. The workers were observed walking around trucks in the roadway and the majority of the work was taking place within 15 feet of the road.,35
[NAME] 2 moved into street and should have involved AWP first to control traffic. Had to suggest they move AWP crew to be outside the work zone now that they are in the road.,35
The Lead / [NAME] LMA was provided some feedback and coaching about making sure to talk with the Traffic Control [NAME] to let them know what he needs from them and what he expects them to do for him and his [NAME].,35
[NAME] providing traffic control during flying operations. [NAME] allowing traffic to pass on roadway while helicopter was flying overhead. Workers report observation to foreman.,35
One of the flaggers was positioned to far back from the taper part of the traffic zone. [NAME] was asked several times to reposition and refused each time to reposition. His supervisor was notified of the issue.,35
"[NAME] D ( subcontractor for Quanta ) was loading and hauling off mats from ROW. Approaching the loading area off of HWY 35, I noticed there was no traffic signs warning drivers.",35
Needed a traffic spotter to assist traffic through the self - regulated setup due to hill crest and curve. No downstream taper.,35
Hi - viz traffic vest was not worn originally since crew was working in parking lot. After discussion all crew members on the ground decided it best to wear their traffic vests due to potential traffic hazards in the parking lot.,35
"[NAME] was already set up to work, installing culverts and access from county road to open field. They were working to get materials and equipment to begin working. As the TCR drove up, there were no traffic cones around the vehicles in the roadway, and no traffic control signs placed on either side of the worksite",35
The crew was working with only one sign out blocking a city street. We spoke with them about traffic control and the need to have your jobsite clearly defined. We also called the gf and let him know.,35
"Traffic set up in place, however, opportunity to discuss vehicle set up to chip brush in alley vs. street side. This would reduce line of fire exposure from traffic.",35
"Traffic control in the form of traffic cones around vehicles and trailers help prevent public drivers from making mistakes, slow down and avoid striking parked vehicles, trailers, and equipment.",35
Circle for Safety was not completed before pickup and trailer left work zone. Ran over traffic directly in front of truck.,35
"MRO typically don't carry and deploy traffic control device. This was a short term set up, less then 15 minutes. 25 MPH with minimal traffic flow. Sign would of been impractical, but cones would of made the vehicle more visible. Worker was using his strobes.",35
"Traiffic control, failure to utilize spotter for backing, side street, traffic not warn of work area",35
Requested flaggers stay posted on both ends of the work zone to help customers that lived in the work zone and redirect through traffic.,35
"We were located at the main entrance to town and a major highway traffic was light but the vehicles exiting from the highway were traveling fast during their turn,. [NAME] parked to so his vehicle was not in the main traffic flow.",35
[NAME] coached on utilizing paddles when they walk out to stop traffic. They simply stepped out in to the lanes.,35
[NAME] parked in a safe location to avoid traffic concerns. We walked in the street but no moving cars were close to our location.,35
Flaggers allowed traffic to proceed as the helicopter was flying rope across the road. The helicopter was directing overtop of traffic at this time.,35
The task was flagging traffic. The traffic control company was simply parked in the roadway sitting in the vehicle.,35
STOPPED WORK. CREW WAS RECONDUCTORING A THREE CONDUCTOR CIRCUIT. WORK WAS BEING DONE FROM THE ROAD SHOULDER NEAR A FAST AND VERY HEAVY TRAFFIC FM ROADWAY. ROAD SAFE CREW HAD INSTALLED WARNING SIGNS AND TRAFFIC SAFETY CONES ON THE PARKING LANE ADJACENT AND ON THE WHITE LINE NEXT TO THE BUCKET AND DIGGER TRUCKS VERY CLOSE TO TRAFFIC. THIS INSPECTOR REQUESTED THE CREW LEADER TO STOP WORK AND REMOVE TRUCKS OFF OF THE FM ROADWAY.,35
"No taper was in place when I arrived at the work site. Then one was put out, prior to any coaching being provided. They were Thanked for putting it out, so that traffic was aware of the shift over.",35
"Recommended having flaggers available when working in the road or blocking lane of traffic. [NAME] taper would also be helpful, for a visual for oncoming traffic.",35
discussed with crew that the sidewalk was a high traffic area and needed to be closed to keep the public from entering the strike zone,35
"When I arrived at the [NAME] Site, one of the [NAME] members was not wearing a Traffic [NAME] while working near the road. After, I identified myself, he retrieved a Traffic [NAME] and put it on. There was no Flaggers in place for the one lane closure that the [NAME] had set up. This road has a 45 mph speed limit and is very heavily travelled. When asked, the [NAME] agreed that he needed Flaggers to help with the he traffic. [NAME] stated the prior day he had to deal with the same issue. I asked the [NAME] if he had any Stop / Slow paddles, so he could do some Flagging, and after checking the trucks; he said he didnt have any paddles available. [NAME] was asked if there was a way to move his trucks off the roadway, so they they didnt have to block a lane and still could work safety. [NAME] said yes, and move their trucks into a residential driveway. I did provide him with some coaching on it he doesnt feel comfortable with the situation and the set up, that he needs to tell his General [NAME] about his concerns.",35
Traffic control driver drove around barricade into someones front yard. I asked her to be careful she could run over clean out sewer pipe.,35
[NAME] was not on Aldridges THA. I notified the Supervisor and he stopped the work. [NAME] completed the THA and had the [NAME] employees sign - on. I notified the TCR of my findings.,36
"Setting and drilling on one THA, recommended that they be separated as they are two different set - ups",36
Technician failed to get on THA with on - site civil contractor upon arrival. Recommend technicians always sign on to THA's with parties on site.,36
had to request the THA after speaking to foreman. Please present the THA to all parties when they approach the site.,36
Old forms were used for the job briefing and THA that did not include the stored energy / line of fire icon.,36
[NAME] had addendum I filled out but did not address setting up barricades on THA for electrical contact or for the drop zone. [NAME] members work at str 71 added it to THA.,36
THA had one major task. TCR & myself coached contractor into listing each / several steps in this one major task. The hazard recognition was ok.,36
[NAME] was conducting the task of hanging bus bar in the energized station. The THA did not cover the electrical hazards or mitigations involved.,36
"All the tasks were put on one THA for the day. Instead of breaking the task into individual steps, the steps wrote down were tasks. Talked to the crew about the THA expectations and the breakdown of each task.",36
Spoke to foreman for the foundation crew about need for more detail in the THA and need for breaking tasks out. Also spoke about avoiding the use of generic wording,36
"when reviewing the THA, It was apparent that all parties on site had not signed the THA. A review of the document was had and all parties then signed.",36
"THA steps needed to be more elaborate instead of MOB, Set up, Excavate. Several steps could have been incorporated into the THA such as barricade the area, ground the equipment, inspect tools and equipment etc. SIF Icons circled but not listed under the [NAME] section of the THA nor were mitigations listed.",36
"THA was not available onsite with the crew at the time of my visit. [NAME] Supervisor told me that the paperwork was in another truck that was running errands back and forth from the laydown yard. I explained that the Pre - Job Briefing and THA should be available onsite for their reference and to brief visitors to the jobsite. Contractor shall provide easy access to thteTHA for all personnel and all contractors on Site at the start of the activity and upon any changes to the THA or upon any requests to review the THA. Contractor shall make THAs available on the Site at all times. ( AEP Transmission 2020 Contractor Safety Handbook, Article 2. 5. 4 )",36
1. The THA was not signed by any crew members and had no information to clear anything up such as date or job title 2. The THA was also vague and had little information upon arrival at site. The information was just setup and demolition the mitigations were also little in information for a job with a lot of risk.,36
"[NAME], needs to note each hazards associated the task performed by the crew by listing them individually on the THA, and how to mitigate the danger involved in each task step by step.",36
G & L's THA was a little unorganized with steps being identified as a hazard. Also some things were a little difficult to read. Would like to see a little more effort completing the THA and include crew members in the process of completing. Focus more on identifying specific hazards and associated controls for each step.,36
THA not available for review. Contractor is required to review THA with all parties upon arrival to project.,36
[NAME] did not provide their THA when I was on site. Reached out to Supivisor and reminded them that they need to review the THA with everyone onsite including visitors.,36
A few critical steps were missing on the THA. The task should be further expanded on including step like catching off wire or cutting wire for example.,36
[NAME] page of THA was not completed. Mentioned to add in [NAME] as a hazard in the THA. Discussed the importance of these items with the crew.,36
"SIF hazards not identified on THA. Also, a task ( replacing mats ) was begun but was not on the THA.",36
I spoke with the [NAME] - One employees about the extreme heat we will be having this week and the importance of hydration. I had them add this to their THA as a reminder each day.,36
"Hazards on THA listed as "" "" slips, trips, falls "" "" and "" "" pinch points "" "". Reviewed with site foreman the need for specific hazards and mitigations on THA.",36
"Incomplete THA, THA Listed [NAME] Task As Potential Hazards Instead Of Listing The [NAME] Task Then The Hazards Associated With The [NAME] Task",36
The THA was not complete and they did not list Slips trips and falls and hazards associated with their site.,36
"The THA for the work for the day was only broken down to the task level, and hazards / mitigation based on the tasks. The crew was coached on the difference between task / task ( s ) hazard analysis, tasks versus task steps and proceeded to recreate the THA for the day's work.",36
"No THA Was Available For Review, [NAME] Stated Their Supervisor Had The THA With Him At Another Location On The Right Of [NAME], And That Their Supervisor Was With Another [NAME]",36
THA did a very good job of capturing task hazards and controls. [NAME] asked to try to be more descriptive when filling out task steps instead of putting the whole task down as one step.,36
"The THA had: collect tools, inspect equipment, dig hole, set post, pour concrete. One hazard listed was the possibility of the post leaning. The THA was more about quality than safety. It seemed like he did not receive training on the use of a THA.",36
"[NAME] THA covered high level tasks for the steps, but missed a lot of important steps within the tasks. Ask the foreman to separate the tasks to be able to better capture the step by step hazards.",36
"The THAs onsite were adequate for the task listed. However setting poles and removing old structures did not encompass the task that was being conducted, Transferring the conductor. When i spoke with Channing about the OFI all that needed to occur is change the task to Transfer the conductor which demoing the top of the pole would be a step in that task. Easy fix and was fixed prior to me leaving the site.",36
Contractor subbed by [NAME] was in Laydown yard operating and loading an excavator. [NAME] had not reviewed the THA or signed before starting work,36
"Pulled up on site and the foreman walked by, said hi and he kept going and never offered a THA / JHA. Sat there and another worker showed up in a flatbed truck, I asked if he had a THA and was told it's probably in the Forman's pickup that he'd be back, and I was asked to relocate. I was onsite approx. 30 minutes before leaving.",36
"Incomplete THA, THA Listed Loading / Unloading Poles As The Task, THA Listed As The [NAME] As Loading Poles For The Loading Task & Unloading Poles For The Unloading Task.",36
I coached the crew on including trips and falls on their THA especially since the mats were unstable and you can easily misstep and get hurt.,36
[NAME] left their THA in another truck. [NAME] was brought down from bucket truck before they started grounding. [NAME] THA was written and job was discussed before they continued to ground the line,36
Verbiage on the THA such as slips trips and falls and cut puncture wounds. These do not identify the specific hazards that are associated with the task,36
"When I arrived on site I waited before approaching so as not to disturb work in progress. The foreman approached me, after frantically looking through his truck. [NAME] asked if I was the TCR I said yes. Today was his first day on this Job Site. [NAME] could not fine his clipboard that had his THA he believed he sat it on the back of the truck and it must have fallen off when he left the show up. [NAME] immediately started filling out a new THA.",36
The task being performed was not identified on the THA at all. Covered the expectations of identifying task steps with foreman. It was an incomplete THA.,36
Backside of THA was not filled out. Front side was filled out and correct. Spoke with employee and he had the back side filled out within a few minutes.,36
Kent's THA combined multiple tasks. At least 3 THAs were recommended. Steps and hazards not well captured due to condensing informational to one page. Dig - It's THA was missing midday review.,36
"Welding was added on to the THA during the day. The hazard that was listed said "" "" other contractors. "" """,36
"THA Listed Slip Trips & [NAME], But Did Not [NAME] Any Areas Were Someone Could / Would Slip Trip Or [NAME]",36
"Contractors THA and Job Brief was not onsite, apparently another employee left the site with the THA and Job Brief, employee was called and retured the THA returned with in 20 minutes. Contractor had four crews performing separate task ( tie rebar, site layout, excavate for breaker boxes and fabricate wooden forms ) working on one THA. The one THA was vague and missed key steps for the task being performed i. e. did not list fabricating the wooden forms resulting in failing to identify hazards and control measures. Contractor identified high energy present but failed to establish sufficient control methods i. e. under their STKY category they identified Mechanical energy present and there control method as inspecting equipment rather then identifying the swing radius of the excavator and installing barricades as a control. Contractor initialing the PM / after lunch review in the morning so they dont have to review it after lunch. Picture of THA attached.",36
I coached the foreman that the THA must be reviewed everyday at lunch or if they choose not to take a lunch they must review together around mid - day.,36
[NAME] did not have THA present with them in the area they were working. Discussed with crew foreman that THA should be present at the site where work is performed so that it can be updated if needed during the job or reviewed by others coming into the work area.,36
"Was on site for about 30 minutes, no Pre - job or THA presented to learn of Hazards associated to project tasks.",36
The THA prepared for the work read more like a pre - job brief and needed to be broken down to the task level to outline the specific task steps.,36
[NAME] did not review Job briefing / THA after lunch. Showed foreman where to check / Initial after lunch / significant break.,36
"Qualus THA did not identify any steps for the task, for the last two days. The information on the job briefing form is simply mirrored on the THA.",36
"Equipment mechanic preparing to perform repairs on dozer, but did not have a THA identifying his specific hazards nor was he signed on to another THA.",36
"THA was good for someone new to completing THAs. Spoke with woman about adding a step or two and include a few more specific hazards. Also regarding controls, focus on eliminating the hazard is possible, then implement risk reduction as appropriate.",36
THA in use did not account for being caught in between a fixed object and moving equipment; [NAME] coached and improvement made,36
The T - Line crew was working in the substation along side the station crew and did not sign on to the THA.,36
Need to list specific hazards associated with step to be completed not have ditto lines down the page. When pinch points are listed as a hazard need to elaborate on what the actual pinch point is and the method of mitigation THA not completed for pulling out a stuck truck prior to beginning the task.,36
"THA was not completed prior to beginning work. Following review of Job Briefing, Contractor Personnel performing specific tasks shall complete a detailed Task [NAME] Analysis ( THA ) at the physical work location that identifies task steps task steps and lists the associated hazards and mitigation controls. [NAME], before any [NAME] begins or resumes, and before changing any [NAME] procedures or activity at any Site, Contractor shall perform a documented new THA which identifies all known and potential [NAME] Site risks. AEP Transmission 2020 Contractor Safety Handbook, Article 2. 5 - Safety and Health Planning",36
Two [NAME] crews were working on the same project completing different tasks in different areas. No cell service is available in the area limiting communication between the crews. Morning job briefing and THA was completed together. Discussed with the crew that they need to have on hand their on THA to be able to update it.,36
[NAME] members began aerial work before the tha was completed and reviewed. I stopped them until the tha was completed,36
[NAME] had a THA completed and signed but was in another truck away from where the crew was working. Reminded crew to keep the THA with them,36
THA was not at site. Another operator had it at the yard doing work. I discussed with supervisor and correction is already in place. Job Briefing signs have been placed near job site and THA is kept in place.,36
[NAME] forgot the location of the work being done for the task. Please be sure to add this to the THA.,36
THA was not on site when I arrived. Advised Roslovich oversight that paperwork should remain on site at all times when people are working.,36
"[NAME] member completing THA signing off everyone's name, instead of everyone signing on THA individually.",36
P & C crew was using a pre - printed THA with the same tasks and hazards on multiple sheets. I mentioned to the crew that tasks can change and that they need to be written daily.,36
Loading THA only included one step of the task being performed. Explain to crew that each task shall be broken into individual steps. Some additional steps could include staging truck and unstrapping load.,36
During paperwork review I noticed the THA was not adequately filled out. I communicated my concerns with the foreman. [NAME] was receptive and began listing more tasks to the THA.,36
"[NAME] was in the process of drilling an 11ft foot deep hole. Neither the Pre - Job Brief nor the THA had any description of the drilling task. Both listed "" "" inspecting and setting up the drill "" "" but nothing about drilling. I stopped the job and had a stand down with the crew. Asked them to discuss the hazards of drilling and the mitigations and list on the THA.",36
"Did not list task by individual, had everyone listed but then just listed the task the group was performing",36
Some crew members had forgotten to sign THA prior to starting work task. Improvements made all crew members shut down and signed THA,36
Coached crew on the THA is a living document and therefore needs to be updated as work scope changes ( T & C 2. 5. 5 ),36
Dehydration was not mentioned on the THA as a hazard and there was no hydration plan included in it.,36
THA listed 2 tasks on the same THA. The step of hang jumpers would have been another task due to them not being made and the conductor could be pressed in without the jumper being connected therefore it is another task.,36
The THA for the work was a little lean. The tasks are performed in an active surface mine. The contractor shares the work area with large mine equipment and it was extremely dusty. I recommended revisiting the THA and adding more detail.,36
"[NAME] page of THA was not completed. Other fields on the PJB cover similar information, but we must ensure every applicable field is completed.",36
"The back side of the THA was not completed to include relevant information for the Emergency Action Plan section, Additional PPE Required and Tools sections, [NAME] Area Conditions, Equipment in Use, and did not indicate that equipment in use was grounded and barricaded and included a drop zone. Contractor shall perform and complete the contents of a written THA Form.",36
THA wasnt available at the landing zone where crews were unhooking conductor and rolling it up. The THA was completed but with another crew further up the line.,36
Consistently including more of hazards and being specific on THA perhaps by including crew in the creation of THA each morning would result in a variety of view points and capture more of the real hazards and mitigations.,36
"Todays job brief and THA were the same ones used yesterday with the date changed. [NAME] was unaware that this was permissible. I gave [NAME] and [NAME] are AEP contractor handbook and pointed out the article which gives the guidelines for job, briefs, and THAs. I had them fill out a new THA.",36
"PJB listed 3 different tasks, Drill and set structure 23, Drill and pour structure 22 and setting up holes but had 1 THA that combined all of those tasks. Each task on the PJB requires its own THA. For example the task of drilling and setting a base in one location would be a THA and drilling an excavation and pouring concrete in a different location with a different set up is another. THA had no signatures",36
The THA completed was just a copy of what was on the job briefing. The THA should be a step by step break down of the task.,36
[NAME] needed to have the foreman from other crew on her THA and her on his. Taken care of after I mentioned it,36
"[NAME] was performing a task that was not captured on a THA. After talking through observation, one foreman was in the process of including work on a THA.",36
"[NAME] did an excellent job of noting the hazards involved with their concrete pour on the THA. It was recommended that the THA include information on the crew's on - site concrete neutralization kit, it's location, and application, in the event anyone had contact to the skin in order to prevent concrete / chemical burns. All employees knew where their kit was located on the jobsite.",36
When arriving at the site and reviewing the THA I noticed that no one had signed onto the THA other than the foreman. I notified the foreman that no one was on the THA and asked him to go over the THA with his crew and have them sign on. [NAME] review the THA and everyone signed it. I notified the TCR of my findings.,36
crew did not have any mention of using spotters on the THA. The areas being accessed today were tight and or rough terrain.,36
The crew used the crane to remove rings from foundations and are cleaning up bolts on the foundation. This task was not listed on the THA.,36
"One THA could have been separate into two different tasks. Also, ensure stored energy / line of fire icon is incorporated in all THAs and job briefing form as needed.",36
[NAME] had a very vague hazards listed on THA. I spent time with the employee explaining hazards and how they should be specified on the THA.,36
"We had a very informative discussion about the need for each drilling crew having their own THA. They did sign onto a THA of a nearby drilling crew, however we all agreed they needed to have their own as well. The [NAME] and crew were very cooperative, wore all of there PPE and had an organized job site.",36
Was onsite for 20 - 30 minutes and was never brought a THA or even acknowledged by crew. Finally spoke to supervisor and asked for THA.,36
"During my observation I observed that multiple THA's were being used to outline the steps for the main tasks for the day, I did like the way that was completed. We did talk about describing the differences between task steps and hazards.",36
"COACHING MOMENT: [NAME] had a very detailed THA filled out, however it was among previous THAs from that week. I suggested that they organize their paperwork so the current THA is readily available. They agreed and were very cooperative.",36
Mechanic did not have THA for servicing equipment and original THA was not update as required while a event has been identified.,36
"No THA / JHA was filled out and the person responsible had no intention to fill one out, had it not been for our safety observation visit. We stressed the importance of such a document.",36
There was no THA referencing the task of removing cover from the energized 12kV. The work was just beginning.,36
Several guys on the THA had already initialed the THA for the afternoon and it was before 9am. Looked like they initialed it when they signed it for the morning which makes me wonder how much [NAME] they spent reading it before they even signed it,36
"[NAME] never approached me with the THA. Eventually, I found it and reviewed it myself. This was a concrete pour and everyone was busy.",36
"THA was lacking details, only listing one step in the task steps. [NAME] had not completely filled out both the front and back of THA. THA did not fully incorporate high energy hazards and direct controls in steps.",36
"Mid - day review had not yet been completed @ 230pm. Spoke with the crew and recommended finding a safe stopping point and reviewing planning documents. During the mid day review, an electric fence for the nearby horses was identified and added to the THA's.",36
Now that crews are working in town the work environment has drastically changed. THA did not list any additional steps or precautions to reflect working in town.,36
"THA did not list the tasks that were being performed, re drilling the excavations, pumping water out of the excavations. Grounding the equipment was not listed, nor discussed",36
[NAME] of the job such as heavy rotating equipment marked on the THA ( SIF ) but not talked about in the hazard section of the THA,36
Noticed an employee not signed onto the daily briefing a THA. Once pointed out the foreman had him review and sign.,36
"No THA was completed for building forms, and the THAs completed lacked step by step detail. The task itself should not be the only step.",36
"This is the second [NAME] crew, same problem as the first crew. The THA is too high level, the tasks are not broken down to task steps to allow for risks associated with each task step to be identified and mitigation discussed / planned.",36
"During wire pull, it was necessary to change out wire reels. [NAME] did not have a THA for this task.",36
Coaching moment. Coached [NAME] Electric crew about adding an unexpected task to the THA prior to performing the task. Task was added to the THA and work proceeded after everyone signed the THA.,36
LS Traffic Control had AEP THA. It was filled out incorrectly. LS filled out task area with hazards and used vague language.,36
"THA did not include the hot work permit being completed [NAME] to beginning the task, therefore the task and risks / hazards were not identified, nor planned mitigation involved with the task. This must be covered in the THA, or it will not be addressed in the tailboard or job briefing",36
THA missing task steps / hazards / mitigations. Tools being used were not listed or talked about on the THA.,36
"Always have a THA when doing work onsite, Remember to break the job into steps, list them in order, be as specific as possible when describing the task and always include tools, equipment, procedures, and environment. Always identify the hazards for each task and as always be specific to the task being done.",36
THA did not include the task to cut rebar with band saw. Reminded supervisor on the need to include all tasks for the day and modify if needed when tasks are added to the job as necessary.,36
"The THA had not been reviewed yet for the PM. I discussed with the foreman about the need to review the JHA for any extended breaks in work, but that also we needed to do a review around work even if we do not break for lunch. This can also provide a second look to double check that the THA still covers the entire scope of work in case it had changed. Everything else looked good.",36
"Stars attached on THA / JSA were added by myself. THA / JSA had very little detail. I took time and went over with foreman on site, however NRE safety was on site and had signed THA / JSA without adding more detail.",36
Make sure all Hazards are listed on the THA as the discussion is taking place and have the person who is filling it out communicate the items as they are being listed.,36
"The crew did not have their THA available upon arrival on site. After speaking with the foreman, I learned that it had been misplaced. I advised him to either find it or create a new one. The foreman did however verbally discuss the job briefing, tasks, hazards and mitigations associated with the days work.",36
"[NAME] was loading gates and post assemblies at their show up yard, and did not have a THA present, stated that it was out on the Right of way",36
[NAME] was burning brush they had piled up. Nothing on the THA listed anything about burning brush or risks and mitigations involved.,36
"[NAME] THA had only the task of "" "" Air [NAME] "" "". Hazards and mitigations were thorough and accurate.",36
[NAME] stopped aerial work due to high winds. They started a new task of loading and hauling material from one end of the job to the other. I drove up on the crew and asked to the see the pre - job and THA. Pre - job looked good but the THA they were using was still the old one for the aerial work. I coached the crew that anytime a task changes that a new THA needs to be completed for the new tasks hazards and mediations.,36
"THA was missing two employees signatures, after peaking with crew supervisor he told the employees to read and sign paperwork.",36
Only one THA was completed for the two tasks identified on the job briefing form. SIF hazards did not aline from the job briefing to the THA.,36
"The THA regarding demo work task steps could have been expanded on. As well as, identifying slip / fall and strain hazards.",36

"The THA prepared for the work was not broken down to the task step level and was no more detailed than a pre - job brief. The task steps listed were their own tasks, which would then need to be broken down to the task step level to allow the crew to identify hazards associated with each task step, as well as mitigation / controls for each hazard identified.

"I had a coaching moment with the foreman on site about hazard recognition due to generic hazards being listed on THA. Slips, trips and falls, struck by etc. were listed on THA and verbally identified and discussed with crew in tool box according to foreman every morning. I mentioned the importance of involving crew during THA overview and job site assessment / walkthrough to not only verbally identify the hazard but to document what the hazard is. For example, trip hazard - piping, pallets, conduit etc. Tools that can be used when an employee who has never been on site can recognize by reviewing THA and before signing job brief. [NAME] was receptive to coaching moment.",36
"Todays THA needed a little more details. The crew did a great THA but failed to include the use of a gas powered hand held auger that can be operated by one or two workers. They did list some hazards from drilling a six foot hole with it, but no mention of the hand held auger to be used for the job task. I explained that the THA must be all inclusive of the equipment to be used so it could better include all the hazards, and controls involved in using the hand held auger.",36
THA did not have controls / mitigations in place for multiple hazards. Discussed these with crew supervisor and THA was updated.,36

I then requested / asked for the THA / Job briefing to be brought over to me by [NAME] [NAME], the foreman on site. When [NAME], approached me with the THA, he reached the paper leaflet to me without verbally going over it with me in ( step by step ) detail instructions. So I reached the THA / Job briefing back to him without signing the documents, and requested for him to verbally go over the THA and the Job briefing, explaining the job activities that was taken place on AEP job site. [NAME], then in return asked me What cant you read the THA, for yourself?",36
THA needs a little greater detail. This was discussed with the crew. Looking for more details on steps involved in the process and specific hazards associated with those steps. Along with associated mitigations. THA was there but some things mentioned were more generic.,36
THA did not include transporting / loading / unloading trailered side by side around sites. A discussion was had with the foreman to include the risk and mitigations.,36

Task plan identified in WSHP has welding listed as one alone task. Suggested two THAs be completed, one for welding, and one for installing jumpers / bus.",36
While I was reviewing the THA I noticed first that the NRO was not of that days. The crew had went ahead and used the NRO from the previous day. Second thing I noticed while reviewing that days THA was that the hazards were flowed buy a mitigation.,36
"1. GPS Coordinates and / or address of actual work area not on the THAs. The address on the pre - job briefs refer to the show up location. 2. THA is too high level, Truck Setup is on separate THA, [NAME] is too general and should have its own THA that provides a step - by - step plan to execute the task, with associated hazards and corresponding control methods. 3.

"Observed more than one task outlined on the job brief, but only one THA. Typically, each line represents a separate THA associated with it. In this case, since the tasks outlined were all part of the same overall task of concrete demo, I suggest only one line on the job brief to match the THA.",36
"Todays THA for [NAME] foundations lists slips, trips, and falls as a hazard. I used the opportunity to coach and explain that Slips, trips, and falls is not a hazard. It is the result of a hazard. I went over why he listed Slips, trips, and falls. We added that info to the THA and the mitigations. Afterwards the THA was reviewed again by the crew.",36
THA was done very poorly and never had many hazards listed and was one of the worst I've ever saw for detail,36
"THA did not include installing bolt and anchor cages. [NAME] crew did not sign Hiwesco THA for drilling operations, and Hiwesco crew did not sign [NAME] THA for drilling operations. The same tasks were identified but not documented as a group.",36
"While performing an observation, I observed multiple lasers being utilized at the site. While I was overlooking the THA, I noticed that the lasers were not listed as a hazard while in use. I recommended to the foreman [NAME] [NAME] to list the laser as a hazard on the THA and mitigation measures with the usage of lasers.",36
Multiple working crews on site did not perform midday review on the THA. I have asked more than a few times that midday review be completed by each crew. Reminded crews that it is a T & Cs requirement.,36
"THA Listed Slip Trips & [NAME], But Did Not [NAME] Any Areas Were Someone Could / Would Slip Trip Or [NAME]",36
"I pulled up to the NHPL crew. After having been read the THA it was handed to me to review. I noticed a copy of the Job Briefing. It stated the task for the day and hazards, but no mitigation.",36
Job Briefing / THA was filled out and was told that the meeting was held but only one crew member had signed document. Advised crew to make sure that they all signed required documents and to revisit at mid day to review.,36
Dacon crew began work before obtaining the proper pre job and tha. I spoke with the foreman and it was corrected.,36
No THA or job briefing completed by two man crew. Provided each crew member with AEP contractor safety handbook and reviewed THA requirements.,36
"THA was not complete, yet had been filled out, discussed, and signed by all workers that were present, except the supervisor Date was also not recorded on the THA",36
Reverse side of the THA did not list additional PPE to be used for the task Tools to be used for the task also not listed on the THA.,36
"THA does not demonstrate "" "" a detail step by step plan for the task to be performed "" "" noted in the contractor safety handbook. Also, each task noted on the job briefing form should have its own THA completed.",36
"When reviewing the THA, it was noted that task steps were not broken down and only listed the general task to be performed. Also not listed in the hazards section was the walking working surface ( mats ) that are heavily damaged and pose a significant STF hazard. Employees were coached on breaking down the task into steps, as well as taking a better look at the work zone to identify potential hazards. Moving forward, they stated that they would spend more time on the planning portion of the work.",36
[NAME] was performing work onsite without having their THA available. Part of the crew was at a different site performing another task and they had the THA.,36
"[NAME] did not have an AEP THA completed or on - hand. [NAME] also did not have an [NAME] "" "" DTA "" "" ( [NAME] Task Analysis ) completed. [NAME] job briefing did not have SIF hazards identified or 138kv overhead lines indicated.",36
Subcontractor Great [NAME]. The crew is receiving and unloading trucks loaded with wood mats. A THA is not available for the Task. The crew initially planned on building access today. They have a Pre Job Briefing and THA that covers building access roads.,36
Unloading material task was not identified on THA. Spoke with supervisor and task was added and crew was re - briefed.,36
"Contractors THA and Job Brief was not onsite, apparently another employee left the site with the THA and Job Brief, employee was called and retured the THA returned with in 20 minutes. Contractor had four crews performing separate task ( tie rebar, site layout, excavate for breaker boxes and fabricate wooden forms ) working on one THA. The one THA was vague and missed key steps for the task being performed i. e. did not list fabricating the wooden forms resulting in failing to identify hazards and control measures. Contractor identified high energy present but failed to establish sufficient control methods i. e. under their STKY category they identified Mechanical energy present and there control method as inspecting equipment rather then identifying the swing radius of the excavator and installing barricades as a control. Contractor initialing the PM / after lunch review in the morning so they dont have to review it after lunch. Picture of THA attached.",36
"The THA had the task to be conducted as sag conductor, press in and make up jumpers. This is would be 2 different tasks. Making the jumpers is not a step in the sagging and pressing in of the conductor. This task would require a different THA. Also the THA as it sets had not steps listed for the making up of the jumpers.",36
Dig It's THA was still just including the task itself as the steps. Reiterated that the task should be broken down to identify specific hazards and controls for each step.,36
"THA needs to be more elaborate and cover all steps to completing the task, such as setting up EPZ, inspecting equipment and grounding for the conductor pull for example.",36
The crews split up and are now performing different tasks. A THA for the second crew was not available. The foreman stopped and created a THA.,36
"Todays THA did not list Silica Exposure as a hazard. During the review of the THA. Pointed that out and the contractors reviewer added the hazards and controls for silica dust, eliminating the hazard deficiency.",36
Visitors on site need to be met with JB and THA sooner on work site. When scope changes the documentation should be pulled out and updated,36
During review of THA / Job briefing [NAME] did NOT complete a Hot [NAME] / Welding Permit. I communicated my concerns with the foreman and the CM.,36
[NAME] prior comments in JHA and THA about working in proximity to energized power line during operation of the crane.,36
THA was extremely vague and lacked details regarding hazards and mitigation controls ( see photo documentation ). Discussed with crew the need to highlight specific hazards and control measures. One example was a railroad crossing approximately 400 yards from a flagger station which should have been noted on THA. Further discussion with a newer employee ( 30 days ) indicated onboard training does not include THA and Job Briefings. Recommend that RoadSafe employees assigned to AEP projects receive additional training on THA and Job Briefings.,36
"THA did an excellent job of noting hazards and necessary mitigations, recommended to crew foreman that their THA include AEP station / line crew activities to ensure everyone on site is aware of work being performed on the jobsite. Notes were included to THA and signed by all parties on site.",36
"[NAME] noticed that they had forgot to date the THA today, not a huge deal but we want to make sure they are dated each day.",36
"The THA today for [NAME] had slip, trips, and falls listed as a hazard. I explained that slips, trips, and falls is not a hazard. It is the result of a hazard. Reviewing the THA with the worker. We added the hazard information and removed slips, trips, and falls. A better THA for today including using the SIF Icons to provide a better THA each day.",36
Prejob briefing not available fore review. Contractor is required to review THA with all parties upon arrival to project.,36
"THA for both crews listed overall scope of work as "" "" Task to be performed "" "", and actual tasks ( not task steps ) were listed in task steps column. Coached ( 2 ) crews on proper THA creation. [NAME] and crew working along roadway, foreman was simultaneously watching aerial work and also directing traffic on 2 lane road ( 1 lane blocked by ongoing work ). This individual had his back to traffic approaching from behind. Coached on proper use of spotter, observer, and traffic control, and also recognizing hazards.",36
Contractor failed to list a step by step plan for all task resulting in failure to identify additional hazard and was to mitigate those hazards. Contractor listed on their THA the task of demolishing the light and foundation. Missed multiple task / steps and the electrical hazard when working around the trigger distance. [NAME] attached THA.,36
"There was not enough detail regarding the tasks for Kwest. THA should have been separated into two. Hazards were not properly identified, with specific controls.",36
"One of 2 THA's was very vague, non - specific and listed hazards like slips / trips. Reviewed with crew the differences between this THA and the other one on site which had specific hazards and mitigations.",36
"Midday Review on THA and PM Review on Pre - Job Briefing were not acknowledged / completed by crew members. Silica Dust Exposure was identified as a Potential / Existing [NAME] and facemask / pour water every 10m as Elimination / Control Methods for the task of demoing concrete slabs, but these controls were not observed in practice by crew members. When I asked [NAME] Supervisor why these controls were not being used even though they were identified, I was told that they mustve forgotten. This would be a good reason for reviewing the Pre - Job Briefing and THA after lunch breaks or any other extended breaks. 2. 2. 4 Owner expects all Contractor Personnel to continuously assess the Jobsite and [NAME] activities for hazards throughout the day. Whenever a problem, circumstance, or result that was not covered in the Job Briefing is encountered during the course of the [NAME], Contractor shall stop [NAME] immediately, evaluate the situation, and conduct a new or revised Job Briefing before resuming [NAME]. Contractor shall immediately communicate to all affected personnel ( see section 2. 2. 2 ) any changes to the Job Briefing that occur during the performance of [NAME]. ( AEP Energy Delivery 2024 Contractor Safety Handbook, ARTICLE 2. 0 | SAFETY & HEALTH PLANNING ) 2. 5. 1 Contractors assigned supervisor or lead shall review the THA with each Contractor Personnel prior to the start of each task and anytime the [NAME] procedure changes. Additionally, the Contractors assigned supervisor or lead shall review the THA with each Contractor Personnel crewmember after lunch and / or after any significant break in the [NAME]. ( AEP Energy Delivery 2024 Contractor Safety Handbook, ARTICLE 2. 0 | SAFETY & HEALTH PLANNING )",36
THA did not include the hazard or mitigation for the concrete pour task for chemical burns. Asked the supervisor on site if there was an eyewash bottle or stations for employees to use in case of accidental concrete splatter to the face or eyes and there was none.,36
[NAME] members framing poles did not have THA onsite. [NAME] member forgot the THA at their laydown yard,36
"I arrived on site at structure 14, I asked the crew member for their THA. At that time I was told that they were on the THA at Str 13. After a little discussion it became clear that since there was work being performed at this site that there needed to be a THA for this job site.",36
"THA Incomplete, THA Listed Pinch Points In The Hazards Location Of The THA, The Mitigation Section Listed [NAME] By [NAME] Radius Of Drill",36
"[NAME] needed to elaborate more on the slip and trip hazards written in the THA. Spoke about the focus 40 THA initiative and the crew was very receptive. [NAME] added more detail and pointed out where one could slip, trip or fall.",36
[NAME] THA was missing step by step breakdown of the tasks. The job briefing form indicated two separate tasks but only one THA was completed.,36
Addressed the importance of the crew to review and initial the THA for the task they assigned to after lunch or long break.,36
Had to retrieve the THA for the DACON below crew myself. No one reviewed the THA with me and did not bring it to me.,36
THA was general without specific defined procedures and hazard controls for these activities listed.,36
THA had two tasks on it combined. One was to install guard structures and the other was to install coverup on the live distribution. In the event that coverup needs to be installed before the guard structures are erected that can be considered 1 task with the cover up as a step other than that it would be considered two different tasks.,36
THA had task as a step and was very vague. This was discussed with EPC [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME] McAfee.,36
"SIF icons marked but hazards not discussed Steps listed as tasks on the PJB. For example inspecting equipment listed as a task when it is a step of then task of clearing ROW. Employees were coached and explained how the PJB and the THA worked in conjunction with each other. Slips trips and falls, sharp objects and pinch points listed as a hazard without elaborating what the actual hazard was such as slips due to muddy terrain, trips due to obstructions in the walking area etc.",36
"THA Incomplete, THA Did Not [NAME] The Known Hazards As Required For [NAME] Set - up & The [NAME] Involved For Setting The Poles And Removal Of The Old Poles",36
THA tasks was listed as clipping in and additional tasks for pulling out stuck trucks was not added to THA [NAME] did not conduct midday review as of 4pm,36
THA was not signed indicating review had been completed. Contractor shall ensure that each crew member performing work shall sign their name verifying that he / she understands the THA and will adhere to it.,36
[NAME] needs to form a better habit of consistently reviewing THA after lunch breaks. Discussed with foreman that things may not always change from the morning briefing but still needed a after lunch review.,36
[NAME] was getting ready to top old wood h - frame structure. This task was not documented on the THA.,36
"No THA / JHA was filled out and the person responsible had no intention to fill one out, had it not been for our safety observation visit. We stressed the importance of such a document.",36
"THA in use contained generalization like: Slips, trips and falls. [NAME] coached that specifics are needed such as: [NAME], rutted, muddy and uneven terrain. Improvement made. THA did not account for biting and stinging insects and animals. Improvement made.",36
"Subcontractor to [NAME] [NAME], [NAME] Logix. The crew filled their companys JHA but did not have an AEP THA document.",36
"1. THA for strip / set forms is too high level, reads like a pre - job brief. Tasks need to be broken down to task step to allow the crew the opportunity to identify hazards associated with each task step. The task strip forms has only one entry for the task of "" "" Strip Forms "" "" with the task of "" "" Set Forms "" "" only having one entry as well. A reasonable case could be made to justify one THA for each of these tasks. 2. The THA for "" "" Trench / Spade for Trenway Installation "" "" has 5 task steps, which easily could be split to 3 THAs with one each for Spade / Dig Dirt, Breakout Concrete with Mini, and Install Trenway.",36
There are currently two separate THA's being used today but I recommend a third be utilized by the rob busters.,36
Observed generic terms on THA's for multiple tasks. A discussion was held with the site supervisor and crew. Take time while completing the THA to discuss in detail what hazards will be encountered and list the specific controls as well. Get the entire crew involved in the THA process to add more value to the discussions in the morning and throughout the day. The crew was very receptive during the discussion.,36
The [NAME] crew is switching out hoses that are under pressure. None of these work tasks are listed on todays THA.,36
THA did not adequately identify hazards associated with task. THA print off was shrunk down to a 50 % ration not providing enough space to write in.,36
"I visited the Precision Pipeline crew ( N. [NAME] to [NAME] - hill ) job site today. As I arrived on site I waited a reasonable ( Approximately 10 minutes ) time, for someone with Precision Pipeline, to approach me and go over the THA and the job briefing. I then requested / asked for the THA / Job briefing to be brought over to me by [NAME] [NAME], the foreman on site. When [NAME], approached me with the THA, he reached the paper leaflet to me without verbally going over it with me in ( step by step ) detail instructions. So I reached the THA / Job briefing back to him without signing the documents, and requested for him to verbally go over the THA and the Job briefing, explaining the job activities that was taken place on AEP job site. [NAME], then in return asked me What cant you read the THA, for yourself?",36
THA not signed by Supervisor. Drill and set poles combined on one THA. This was discussed with supervision and it was agreed that a separate THA was needed and was two separate tasks. Midday review not conducted.,36
[NAME] was working near energized lines / equipment and did not have them noted / discussed on the THA paperwork.,36

THA in use needed more detail regarding job steps and associated job hazards. [NAME] coached and Improvements made.,36
Coaching Moment Worked with the employee to add additional detail to the THA and went over examples of where it was needed.,36
"The THA was too high level, tasks were not broken down to task steps to allow for risks associated with task steps to be identified along with mitigation associated with the risks for each step.",36
"THA in use did not account for stinging and biting insects and animals. Generalization: Slips, trips and fall used on THA. Specifics needed such as: [NAME], muddy, rutted and uneven terrain. [NAME] coached and improvements made.",36
"THA did not break tasks down in steps. THA did not identify specific hazards, and rather just listed electrical, gravity, etc. THA did not identify specific control measures and mitigations for hazards.",36
THA has multiple tasks listed on the same document instead of breaking the tasks out into separate THAs,36
"[NAME] signatures were wrote in by foreman. Explain to foreman that each individual part of the crew should be signing the THA. This ensures that each crew member fully understands the work and hazards, and reviews the THA.",36
no THA was performed prior to start of work. Stopped crew until THA was written and discussed with team members. I will check on them again later to verify that they have corrected this habit.,36
"Reviewed THA with crew member and coached them on identifying specific hazards and mitigations on the THA, and not using generic terms. The employee was able to speak in detail about the specifics and updated the THA to capture them.",36
Two crews on site working to remove air bridges / mats. [NAME] detailed THA readily available with hazards identified and controls in place. [NAME] preformed midday review of THA.,36
[NAME] air spading a trench for conduit and control cable and didnt mention flying debris on the THA,36
Older digger truck at Aransas [NAME] does not have barricade poles mounted at an angle that creates rope separation from front and rear bumpers,37
"[NAME] rope was used to define boundary around manlift. As there was not enough red rope to go around the man - lift a section of yellow rope was used. [NAME] to the rope being short, the backside of the man - lift was hanging over the rope barricade by about 12 "" "".",37
Utilizing truck as a rope rig without a barricade. Had discussions with Superintendent and foreman while on site.,37

Recommended tying off rope to help with walking up the hill and pull tools and material up the hill.,37
The crew wrapped the pulling rope around the underground and tapped it when pulling in. The crew should have used a pulling sock for ease of pulling in. The underground got stuck in the meter base due to the rigging used.,37
Tool for the job. Recommended to the crew to choose a better method to barricade open trenches. The current barrier tape could have broken and potentially caused a outage. Recommend to use something stronger such as rope or cones.,37
The LCS was provided coaching related to a truck moving with its barricade ropes still in place and the driver stepping over the rope to get in the cab.,37
[NAME] member approached truck to retrieve a rope from the side box while boom was still within close proximity to the primary.,37

[NAME] was receptive and a rope was used for the remainder of the job.,37
"Discussed the importance of communicating early when working with a group that is not close to your work area. The crew was pulling wire. One half of the crew was at the rope end of the job. the other half of the crew was pulling the ropes in about a 1 / 4 to 1 / 2 mile away. The rope on the drum was getting low and communications needed to be made quickly to keep the other crew from pulling the rope drum off the pole or damaging any equipment. The crew was communicating by cell phone, and it takes time to dial the and wait for the other party to answer, assuming they hear it ring. Everything worked out ok, but there was not much time left before the rope would of ran out, potentially causing some rework. We discussed quicker communications, leaving the phones on at all times, or having designated radios ( walkie talkies ) to use for instant communications.",37
"[NAME] had rope set to pull tree along side the three phase line. I asked the foreman which direction they were going to take the tree and he said along lines.

[NAME] Extension structures 36 - 3 rope pull was indicated in the plan to be done by helicopter. [NAME] were preparing to do the rope pull by hand without NRE having submitted a new pull plan for review with AEP.,37
[NAME] was using pull rope to pull the winch line back. They were trying to pull up on the rope up at the base of the pole. I suggested putting a hand line block up a few feet on the pole where they could just walk with the rope instead of bending over and pulling up every 3 or 4 feet.

"The crew was placing concrete as backfill for a pole butt that was being set. When I came around the concrete truck there was an employee, who I believe to be the crew lead, leaning across the excavation with one hand on the pole attempting to level it without fall protection or guardrails in place. I asked said individual how far the concrete was to the top of excavation, in which he replied 5 - 6. I cautiously approached the hole to investigate, in which I determined that distance to be 10 - 12. I then stopped the crew and asked them to step back away from the excavation while I investigated further. To give some backstory, it was determined earlier in the project that if the pole butt was in the excavation that fall protection and guardrails were not necessary because there was only 6 - 10 of space between the pole and excavation wall not leaving enough space for an individual to fall in. In speaking with the employees they stated the above as to why there were not appropriate precautions put in place. I then stated that this was not a normal size hole, with this hole having 18 - 3 from pole to excavation wall, and that fall protection and guardrails were absolutely necessary due to these distances. I then coached them that they need to be proactive about looking for, identifying, and then putting appropriate precautions in place to combat hazards and not to just falling back on what they have been doing. After speaking with the crew I approached their safety rep which was sitting in his truck about 60yrds away and out of view of the work being preformed. While speaking with the safety rep he stated that we ( AEP ) needed to have some consistency because it was fine for them to utilize the practice stated above before but now it is not acceptable. I then stated to him that they needed to use common sense and that if there was sufficient amount of room for an individual to fall in the excavation that fall protection and guard rails were absolutely necessary. [NAME] wanted to investigate for himself so we walked to the excavation and he then determined that fall protection and rails were needed.

"Employee started maneuvering into cover up primary, QO not observed, Supervisor caught the movement and stepped in to observe",48
"One of the employees was noted as the qualified observer, but did not speak up when the employee working aloft moved into a position where additional cover - up was required. I asked him about the employee's position relative to the cover - up and he did not understand the risk of exposure there. We then asked the worker aloft to come down and explained how he positioned himself beyond the protection of the cover - up on the phase behind him and that he needed to add a line hose. The worker aloft understood and added the cover - up. The qualified observer learned that he needed to pay closer attention to the cover - up coverage and speak - up if the workers aloft get too close the exposed conductors.",48

"When receiving the job briefing it was learned the worker aloft would use the lip of the bucket to raise the lines to the new cross arm. [NAME] was stopped to discuss other options. It was decided to use a second worker in bucket to hold the line while the bucket was raised. Once the workers were in position they changed their method to use the jib's winch line and link stick to move the line. Needing to move the middle phase first they untied the phase, attached the link stick and boomed above the line to lift it. When doing so, they couldn't lift the line high enough to get their gloved hands on the line to help guide and steady the line into position and tie it in. They set the line on the pole top pin insulator, unsecured, until they could get in position to tie it in. Afterward, we discussed the hazards with this method and alternative ways to do the work.",48

[NAME] was replacing a three - phase straight line pole. The two outside conductors were not energized or in use. Before my arrival crew had transferred the roadside conductor ( not energized ) without the use of cover up. The center conductor ( energized ) was transferred with the use of cover up. [NAME] was stopped and corrections were made. [NAME] up was applied to the outside conductors and the field side conductor was transferred. Review job site grounding policy with GF.,48
"Upon arrival worker aloft was observed positioned between bypass jumpers with no cover - up. Worker was connecting pole ground to bypass switch while in reach of two energized potentials. After the connection the worker exited MAD and continued work on the recloser. I had a discussion with LCS about the deficiency. The pole ground was left unattached until the bypass jumpers were installed to prevent a possible phase to ground contact. Covering up the jumpers to gain safe access to the connection point is perceived to be difficult to accomplish and increases contact exposure. Lesson learn - When applying cover - up, works positioning is half the battle and decreases exposure to contact exposure.",48
Outrigger pads placed in wet soil on one side. I suggested spreading some of the available gravel to cover that side of the crane outriggers.,48
Briefing was created while crew was working a single phase line. [NAME] was working a 3 - phase at the time of my observation.,48

The worker in the bucket had wrapped the jib winch line around the phase instead of using a sling. We requested that he use a sling to secure the phase in the jib winch line.,48
Coached crew on the need to cover additional non - energized potentials. This was immediately corrected.,48
"This crew had one bucket holding a phase in the jib phase holder and the neutral in the winch line with an insulating link stick. The other bucket had two phases on the end of the boom again. One was in the phase holder of the jib, and the other phase was secured to the bucket behind the operator. I reminded them again that they can only have one conductor on the end of the boom. The second conductor must be on the winch line with an insulating link stick or put both conductors in a phase tree. The moved one phase to the winch line with an insulating link stick. I requested that the leadership on site review the manufacturer's limitations in the operating manual and share these restrictions with their crews.",48
After initial cover up installed stoped crew so an extra hose could be installed on an outside phase that would have been exposed to the boom as truck set up was st an angle a further from pole,48
I stopped the work and asked the lineman to add more cover up to energized conductors below the bucket,48
"Lineman [NAME], in handling energized phase with mechanical jumper placed phase with mechanical jumper hot clamp on fiberglass cross arm without beforehand covering with rubber blanket. Brought it to crew foreman's attention. [NAME] stopped and discussed crew foreman and linemen the need to apply proper cover up at all times and never trust fiberglass cross arm to have any insulation value.",48
"Recommended crew use more cover - up on system neutral, once that was pointed out crew did a good job of covering up.",48
"[NAME] had adequate hoses in place and were utilizing small split blankets while tying conductor in, however there was exposure to the employee's side on the crossarm while tying in field phase. Had a good conversation and coached on needing to make sure to protect themselves from different potentials and accidental contacts. Coaching was well received and appreciated.",48
"Briefing did not cover the use of the chainsaw, chaps, and hearing protection while removing the crating material. This task was considered routine and not hazardous enough to cover specifically. I recommended they cover the use of the chainsaw and the appropriate PPE anytime they plan to use it.",48
[NAME] did not have good cover up talked with the crew about the issue Qualified observer need to be checking on the linemen make sure his got enough cover up,48
"One worker was holding the road phase in the phase holder of his jib. [NAME] moved in to help the other bucket worker tie in the center phase. We stopped him and reminded him that he can only engage one phase at a time with his bucket. [NAME] recognized his error and moved away. [NAME] Electrical Safety [NAME] 4. 11: When two or more employees are working within reach of each other, they shall not work simultaneously on different phases or on items at different potentials.",48
Static wire was getting pulled over single phase distribution with cover up installed. [NAME] operating bucket truck that was going to be used as guard structure wasnt positioned correctly to provide adequate protection.,48

[NAME] A lineman in bucket was removing temporary cut bars and placed hot end inside of bucket with no cover.,48
"The employees did utilize a proper barricade, but it came out of a discussion of realizing the scope change in the job. They had been performing de - energized work on the pole and were about to go up to hang a three - phase switch bracket. I noticed one of the employees had cover - up in his bucket, and intended to go up and install cover up to install the bracket. We halted them, and discussed that this would be a scope change that would require the barricading of the trucks and a QO to perform this task. The employees did a quick re - brief, set out proper barricades on both buckets, assigned QO, and safely completed their work.",48
enough cover up was used to do the task that they were working on. I talked to them about protecting the bucket and boom when moving out of that area of cover up,48
"To use the exception in electrical rule 2. 03, all energized conductors and equipment must first be covered. This crew did not apply any cover on the pole.",48
"Discussed installing load side leads with crew and NE. SEA brought up installing load side leads with bus energized. Talked through proper way to cover up, use of pipe etc to perform task. NE on crew has not been trained in working near procedures and made the call to get a bus outage and install the leads to a de - energized switch. NE made the correct call for the task given he has not been trained. Training center is working on expanding cover up training for Station Electricians need to include NE supervisors as well.",48
"One of the crew member noticed the primary was damaged, he called for a stop job so wire could be caught off in a strap hoist. The wire was grounded, but was running over the top of energized 3 phase conductors.",48
[NAME] crew did not have enough cover at this point to run copper from the top of the pole to the bottom,48
"[NAME] slid line hoses up to the insulators but did not cover the exposed primary on top of the insulator. The work was being done on the center phase that was sitting on the crossarm. The worker was positioned next to the pole while securing the phase to the new insulator. [NAME] covered the crossarm, but his shoulder was right next to the pole and pole ground. I recommended to the foreman / QO that they need to cover the pole too. The pole is grounded and he is hands on energized primary. [NAME] agreed. They corrected the cover - up.",48
"HP arrows were used in great capacity. However, the use of cover up on the panel next to the one they were working on would have helped mitigate risk even more. Both panels looked near identical.",48

"While there was cover up used for their primary task of jacking steel, the task of unloading them into a trailer on the other side of the trucks need more cover up.",48
I had to tell the crew to install more hoses. The crew was working a buck pole and was trying to relocate a phase. When the crew boomed around To get into position to lift the phase they had the jumper within inches of the bucket with out any hoses.,48
"Visited with two crews working on the same task with four bucket trucks bumping over line equipment and taps to new line with very little cover up, when they have six energized lines and two neutrals one of the lineman only had three line hoses on all eight conductors, I informed the Foremen in charged about the importance of having the right amount cover up and that we needed to be corrected and make it right for their own safety",48
"The crew was using the jib, a hose, and blanket to move the phase. They were basketing in. After seeing this I talked with the crew about the proper methods of moving phases. After this another guy was put in the bucket and they were able to move the phase by hand to the lay out arm.",48
Workers failed to notify observer to re - engage when moving back into the primary zone to take off cover up. We discussed the need to have that conversation when re - entering the zone to remove cover up.,48
The two workers aloft had transferred the road phase to the hot arm. They placed enough line hoses for the work but they left the phase holder exposed. They still needed to move the center phase toward the road phase. I had the foreman stop the work and requested that they cover the phase holder before they moved the center phase and place themselves within reach of the uncovered portion of the road phase while handling the center phase.,48
"Worker aloft boomed over uncovered grounded span guy to cover phase. When installing mechanical jumper system neutral, span guy and pole lacked adequate cover. Reviewed cover - up high risk procedure with foreman.",48

"The crew did not use line hoes on the neutral nor did they cover the neutral while lifting it into the new install location. Question these activities and was advised that with the line having no chance of phase to phase and the fac that the line is isolated did not need. However, coached best practices is to properly cover the line when lifting since it has the potential to carry voltage. [NAME] members agreed and no further action is needed.",48
"talked with crew foreman about needing to cover the cross arm as well when doing his cover up. Employee in bucket reached under the arm to assist other employee with making jumper up and kept looking over his shoulder to see if he was in the clear. Employee was in the zone and with in min approach distance to the energized wire and arm. Talked about if you are questioning if you are too close to something, then it needs to be covered. All other cover up was excellent at job site. This was this crews first week on the job. [NAME] was very nice and understood the reason.",48

It was getting late in day ( beyond normal work hours ) and JL failed to cover stinger and solid blade cut - out which was within reach as he placed lightning arrestor on pole.,48
"BEFORE the task began both crews had a great discussion with questions about the steps for cover up placement. On a three phase double circuit, to lay out wires with one side of the bottom circuit, energized, and the other side, not energized. However, there was only one hose put on each side of the neutral. The span of cover up above was 2 to 3 hoses on either side of the phases. I made the suggestion to add the same adequate span of cover - up to the neutral.",48

Spotted a cover that was off of an electrical panel that was energized and had the panel put back in place.,48
"One of the employees was noted as the qualified observer, but did not speak up when the employee working aloft moved into a position where additional cover - up was required. I asked him about the employee's position relative to the cover - up and he did not understand the risk of exposure there. We then asked the worker aloft to come down and explained how he positioned himself beyond the protection of the cover - up on the phase behind him and that he needed to add a line hose. The worker aloft understood and added the cover - up. The qualified observer learned that he needed to pay closer attention to the cover - up coverage and speak - up if the workers aloft get too close the exposed conductors.",48
Notified LMA that additional cover - up was needed when new grounded conductor came thru end roller. LMA agreed and installed an additional layer of cover - up.,48
Employee working aloft was working a lateral single phase tap that had been deenergized but not grounded. [NAME] A line mechanic did not follow appropriate work practices by verifying that cover up was applied to the de - energized conductor / equipment. The line section ran two spans and then dead - ended at an unused transformer location. The LCS took this opportunity to provide coaching on why it is important we do not fall into the error trap of being haphazard while working on lines / equipment that has not been grounded properly. Excellent learning opportunity for the young line mechanic.,48

Because of the perimeter of the work being conducted, AEP Safety requested that the foreman a loft in the bucket come down do you have a discussion with a qualified observer. AEP Safety requested that the energized components on the riser because of her with blankets because the foreman was within minimum approach distance of the energized riser. [NAME] complied, QO engaged, cover up was added. Once energized was covered and the foreman returned to the non - energized riser side, AEP Safety asked the QO to remain engaged do to lack of 3way communication and QO distractions. QO was smoking and drinking an energy drink while also talking to AP2. At one point a pedestrian walked underneath the bucket while work aloft was being conducted and QO just yelled hey. Again, AEP safety requested AP4 to stay engaged in the work aloft.",48

"Job briefing covered to many tasks at hand. Job briefing was not site specific due to one job briefing covering aerial - bucket truck work, manual climbing and flagging tasks which had been performed at a earlier time in the morning.
